THE LOSS
The Ada was wrecked at North Island, Houtman Abrolhos, during the same storm that sank the Columbia. The Geraldton Express of 23 February 1921 reported that the ‘wind blew with almost hurricane force’ and the barometer fell to 29.27 in. The exhausted crew were marooned for two days without food or water before being able to row across South Passage to West Wallabi Island in a leaky dinghy using only one and a half paddles. Here they were rescued by the crew of another fishing boat.","NO","","","","None","","N","","N","N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

"African (Sunset Beach wreck)","1863/01/04","Geraldton, Champion Bay, Sunset Beach","","Gibson","Captain Gibson","Stranded and wrecked between two reefs, near Chapman River mouth","Y","10.00","","Wool, ore","332, AUS 81, 1052","  African was built under Special Survey at Sunderland in 1853. A timber ship, it was copper fastened and sheathed with yellow metal over felt. The owner was Captain J. Gibson. The Lloyd’s Registers of 1857 and 1861 show the Builder’s Old Measurement tonnage of this ship as being 780 and the tonnage under the new Act, which came into force on 1 January 1836, as being 888. As the African was built after this date, only the new tonnage is given above.
THE LOSS
The African sailed from Champion Bay for Fremantle on 1 January 1863. The cargo consisted of 522 tons of copper and lead ore from the Wheal Fortune Mine, near Northampton, and 200 or 300 bales of wool. African began taking on water soon after rounding Point Moore and heading south. A heavy gale from the south-west meant that the crew had to constantly pump the ship to clear the bilges. On 4 January the master and owner, Captain J. Gibson, put about to run back to Champion Bay. At 10.00 p.m. the ship struck a reef about 12 miles south of Point Moore. The African was badly damaged but managed to limp back to Champion Bay, where it ran aground some 140 m from the jetty in 4.6 m of water on the morning of 5 January.
The African had 1.8 m of water in the hold and the Resident Magistrate, Thomas Brown, provided a party of prisoners to take over manning the pumps from the exhausted crew. The cargo was unloaded with only 20–30 bales of wool being damaged, because the lighter wool had been loaded on top of the heavier ore. The leak however persisted. A survey was carried out on the hull with the result that Captain Gibson decided that the vessel was not in a fit state to proceed; it could not be repaired at Champion Bay and he had insufficient funds to take the ship elsewhere for repairs. It was therefore abandoned as a constructive total loss. Mr and Mrs Alf Pead lived on board as caretakers until on 23 March the African dragged anchors in a blow. It fetched up some 5 km north, near the mouth of the Chapman River, lying between two reefs. At this stage two of its masts were still standing. (Henderson, G. and K., 1988: 54) The African was subsequently dismantled and some of the timber used to build three smaller vessels.
INQUIRY
An inquiry into the accident concluded that the damage caused was as a result of striking the reef and not from incorrect loading or existing defects in the hull.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The removal of all the cargo was followed, after the declaration of the African as a total constructive loss, by the sale by auction of the rigging, brass scuttles, capstan and other items. All these items were offered separately, as Captain Gibson considered they would fetch more if sold as individual lots. Luke Leake, merchant, purchased the hull and rigging at auction for £1?000. He intended to have it repaired in an Asian port, however no cash was paid and he later successfully repudiated the bargain in court. The cargo was sold for £350. On 26 May 1863 Lionel Samson, a Perth merchant, wrote to the Geraldton merchants, Daniel Henry Scott and William Gale, suggesting a partnership to purchase the wreck. Scott and Gale declined. A second auction on 22 June resulted in Samson buying the wreck for £70.
Samson employed Daniel Chapman to break up the wreck. Chapman had come to Western Australia as a free man on the Scindian (546 tons), the first ship to bring adult convicts to the colony in 1850. In early July 1863 a letter from the Resident Magistrate, Fremantle, to the Colonial Secretary requested:
Sir,
A free emigrant named Chapman having contracted to break up the wreck of the African now lying off shore at Champion Bay is desirous of employing 5 ticket holders in conjunction with 5 free men to assist in the work.
I have the honour to request to be informed if these 5 men will be permitted to work as aforesaid—the African—although stranded—being as I understand it some distance from the shore.
An immediate reply will oblige as Chapman is in the process of starting…[word indecipherable].
A reply from Governor John Stephen Hampton on 4 July 1863 stated:
I do not see any objection to TL men in the proportion to free men herein mentioned being employed for this purpose. This is a purely convict question and the RM should have written to the Comptroller General on the subject.
A local shipwright named William Garrard bought some of the timber and built three vessels—the schooners Mary Ann (O/No. 36551), launched October 1864, 42 ft (12.8?m) length, 33.28 registered tons; the Lass of Geraldton (O/No. 52231), launched 1865, 60.33?ft (18.4 m) length, 37.1 registered tons; and the sailing lighter Albatross, launched 1867, 18 tons burden. Both the Lass of Geraldton and the Albatross were subsequently wrecked, George Shenton being drowned during the loss of the former, and William Garrard in the latter.
SITE LOCATION
Not all of the timber from the wreck was used to build the three vessels. Some of the remaining timbers still lie some 30–50 m off Sunset Beach, north of Geraldton, near the mouth of the Chapman River. Occasionally bronze fastenings, metal knees and other metal objects may also be seen in the vicinity where the African was broken up.
SITE DESCRIPTION
There has been considerable change over the last twenty years in the coastal geomorphology of this area due to human activity. This is a result of the northward expansion of the city of Geraldton and port developments in Champion Bay.
The area over which the remains are scattered consists of a sandy bottom semi-protected by a small offshore reef. Movement of the sandy bottom results in the occasional exposure of the pieces. At other times build up of sand over the site covers the remains until the next scouring process occurs. Most of the timbers and metal objects lie at a depth of about 4 m when sand has been scoured away.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
Locals assert that about 1964 a section of deck, approximately 12 m by 3.5 m, was recovered at Sunset Beach near the Chapman River mouth. This had on it a 1.4 m high gunwale on one edge and had obviously come from quite a large vessel. The piece of wreckage was dismantled to obtain the bronze fastenings for sale as scrap metal. In November 1979 the Maritime Archaeological Association of Western Australia obtained some representative examples of bolts, Muntz metal sheathing, bones, coal and a bottle during an exploratory dive on the site. Other objects including pieces of wood have been raised at various times to aid in identifying the wreckage.
Struck the reef that now bears the name of the African. Note however that the Chapman River could not have been named after Daniel Chapman who dismantled the wreck, as the first use of the name occurred during Grey’s trek south in 1839. As mentioned above, Daniel Chapman did not arrive in the colony until 1850.
Luke Leake, who made an offer to buy the damaged ship after Captain Gibson had put it up for auction in Champion Bay, was a prominent Perth merchant. He was later to successfully withdraw from any agreement to purchase.
Lionel Samson, who subsequently purchased the vessel for £70 at a second auction held on 22 June 1864, was another prominent Perth businessman. He was able to obtain the vessel for such a cheap price because the African had dragged anchor and drifted from the harbour to the Sunset Beach area about 5 km north of the town. Samson later on-sold some of the timbers to William Garrard, boat builder of Geraldton.
William Garrard, a ship’s carpenter, had arrived in Western Australia as a convict on the Norwood in 1862 and received his ticket of leave within a month. He brought out his wife and children, received a conditional pardon and moved to Geraldton. Shortly after that the African was purchased by Samson and broken up. Garrard purchased some of the timber and built three vessels. He employed up to nine ticket-of-leave men during the construction of the Mary Ann, Lass of Geraldton and the Albatross.
In June 1868 the two schooners Twinkling Star and Sea Bird were driven ashore by a gale at Port Irwin. The Albatross was sent from Geraldton by the Resident Magistrate with salvage equipment and personnel to attempt to refloat the vessels. This proved successful, but on the return journey to Geraldton strong headwinds were encountered. The Albatross turned around in the vicinity of Point Moore to seek shelter back at Port Irwin. Near the mouth of the Irwin River the lighter was rolled over by a large wave, her deck swept clean and eight people drowned, including Garrard. See earlier section on Albatross.
George Shenton had business interests in both Perth and Geraldton and was the owner of the Mary Ann, and part owner of the Lass of Geraldton with Charles Crowther. Shenton was part owner of the White Peaks copper mine, had a financial interest in the Geraldine mine and assisted many settlers with advice and low interest loans as they struggled to set themselves up as farmers on the Greenough Flats. Another of his business ventures was the purchase of land that later became vital for access to the proposed jetty at Port Irwin. When the Lass of Geraldton capsized in a storm 20 km south of the mouth of the Murray River on 25 March 1867, six people drowned including George Shenton. His obituary in the Perth Gazette of 29 March 1867 reads:
What he gained, and he gained much, he diffused largely and judiciously; the corn-fields and mines of the Victoria District are not fruitful and rich because he ploughed and worked them; but he helped others to do so.
It seems probable that ‘Alf’ Pead mentioned above is the Alexander Pead who lost his life five years later when the Albatross was wrecked at the mouth of the Irwin River. There is a strong connection between the African and the Albatross, the latter being built from the dismantled African.
TECHNICAL (2)
The building of three smaller vessels from the remains of the African may be considered an example of 19th century recycling. This was in fact common practice. Time and effort could be saved over that needed to cut and season timber. Metal fittings, spars and sails were also recovered for re-use on other vessels.","NO","UK","","1979/10","","6.50","N","2009/0061/SG _MA-20/79","Y","Y","-28.725579","","48.00","","114.619229","","","23091","Sunderland","Geraldton Champion Bay","London","Fremantle","Aerial GIS","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

"Agincourt","1882/04/19","Hamelin Bay","","J.T. Russell, J. McGeorge and W.L. Dickson","Captain Henry Patching","While at anchor","Y","8.70","","Timber","AUS 116","Agincourt was built by William Doxford under Special Survey and launched in January 1863. It was copper-fastened, sheathed with felt and yellow metal, and had a raised quarter deck 12.5 m long. The vessel had been owned by various UK owners until 1880, when it was purchased by a Mr MacGregor of Adelaide. Subsequent owners were the partners W.L. Dickson, C. Russell and E. Trevett, although Dickson is the sole owner listed in Lloyd’s Register of 1882–83. The Agincourt had arrived in Hamelin Bay on 17 February from Adelaide. The barque, under the command of Henry Patching with a crew of eight, had anchored ‘five cables from the jetty in five fathoms water… the jetty was bearing S½E and Edith Ledge bearing N by W½W’ (Captain Patching’s evidence, CSO1455/64). On 19 April it was loaded with timber and ready to sail. The north-west breeze was moderate but later developed in to a gale, with a heavy swell from the same direction.
THE LOSS
The Agincourt dragged the port anchor (nautical assessor’s evidence, CSO 1455/64) or parted the port anchor cable (Captain Patching’s evidence, CSO 1455/64). The starboard anchor was dropped but too late to prevent the barque heavily striking Inside Rocks four times. The captain ordered the cable to be slipped and ran the vessel towards the shore, where it went aground in about 5.5 m of water at 3.00 p.m., less than 30 m from the beach. The pumps were manned but without success. At this time, without the master’s consent, the crew launched the ship’s boat. They were ordered back on board, but headed towards the shore where the boat capsized. Here the ship’s carpenter, William Mitchell aged 50, who could not swim, was drowned.
Captain Patching stated in a letter to the editor of the Inquirer dated 15 May 1882 that the reason the port cable parted was that its long scope enabled it to get caught under the rocky ledges. As soon as he had heard the surging of the port cable he knew it had parted and immediately dropped the starboard anchor, letting out 75 fathoms (137 m) of cable. This stopped the Agincourt, and after taking bearings at 8.00 a.m. to ensure that it was not dragging, he went below for ten minutes to eat breakfast. He then returned on deck, and noted that the vessel had not altered position but an already heavy sea was increasing. He therefore ordered springs put on the starboard cable to help prevent surging. This took until 11.30 am, after which he had the crew man the windlass to heave in the port cable so as to fasten on another anchor. However with every swell the vessel began dragging so he stopped heaving ‘so as to give the ship the benefit of the cable that was then out’, a length of about 45 fathoms (82 m). At 12.45 p.m. the vessel struck Inside Rock. Immediate sounding of the pump well showed 18 in (0.46 m) of water which had increased to 26 in (0.66 m) within ten minutes. To save the vessel sinking into deep water he ordered the cables slipped and hoisted the fore topmast staysail to turn the Agincourt’s bow towards the shore, and beached the barque. His explanation of the starboard anchor not holding was that the stock must have caught on a ledge and broken, as the anchor weighed nearly a ton and was attached to a 13/--8 in (3.5 cm) chain, ‘sufficient to drag the windlass out of the ship if the anchor had held’ (Inquirer, 24 May 1882: 3a).
INQUIRY
A Preliminary Court of Inquiry was held at Vasse on 24 April 1882. A Court of Inquiry, held on 6 and 9 May 1882 at the Busselton court house, charged that Captain Patching acted negligently in:
1. That he neglected to sight his anchor from the time of arrival February 17th until April 19th, a period in excess of 2 months, being in an open roadstead, and knowing the bottom to consist of rocks with intervening patches of sand, and surrounded with reefs on every side.
2. That he allowed the ship to drift into danger without taking bearings when he noticed that the vessel had shifted its position, and not taking the necessary means to ensure its safety.
The Court of Inquiry, made up of R. Fairburn, RM., Dr C.S. Bompas, JP., and Mr Forsyth as nautical assessor, also held Captain Patching partly responsible for the death of the ship’s carpenter. His certificate of competency was suspended for six months.
INITIAL SALVAGE
An auction of the wreck of the Agincourt was held in late May 1882, conducted by James Moore at the Wellington Hotel in Perth, ‘and the greater part of it disposed of at very nominal prices, owing to the inaccessibility of the vessel’s position’ (West Australian, 26 May 1882: 3b). The only purchaser was H. Tombs, manager of M.C. Davies’ timber company.
SITE LOCATION
The Agincourt is situated 900 m north of the boat launching ramp at Hamelin Bay, and 120 m offshore. It lies just south and inshore of Inside Rock; which is the exact position given by Captain Patching and the crew in their evidence to the inquiry.
SITE DESCRIPTION:
The wreck of the Agincourt lies on a sandy bottom on an axis of 104°, bows towards the beach, in 5–6 m of water. The lower part of the hull, which cants slightly to starboard, is intact. It has 95 mm thick planks with a ceiling inside of 70 mm planks. Fastenings are mostly yellow metal, with some copper in the vicinity of the keel. The vessel was sheathed with yellow metal, and some of this remains. A rudder gudgeon is on the sternpost, and there is part of the cargo of neatly stacked timber sleepers still in the hull. These sleepers are 2.6 m long by 220 mm wide and 110 mm thick, and they and the timber of the hull have had very little damage from marine borers. The iron barrel of the windlass lies on the starboard side of the bow. Five metres closer inshore there is a section of the upper hull, with seven chainplates still attached. An iron water tank lies between the hull sections.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
The Western Australian Museum wreck inspection of 26–27 April 1977 by Scott Sledge recovered a variety of artefacts including wood samples from the planking, assorted yellow metal fastenings, pot sherds, lead pipe, a number ‘8’ draught marker from the bow and a piece of green bottle glass.","NO","UK","","2002/02","1","5.50","N","2009/0062/SG _MA-356/77","Y","Y","-34.2145683333","","40.20","","115.03366","","","45596","Sunderland","At anchor, Hamelin Bay","Adelaide","At anchor, Hamelin Bay","GPS DoLA Aerial 2004/3/31","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

"Agnes","1892/04/24","Bremer Bay","","Captain Fred Douglas","Captain Fred Douglas","At anchor, went ashore in storm","N","5.50","","General","BA 1034"," Agnes had one deck, a flat bottom, an elliptical stern and a figurehead of the bust of a woman. The vessel had a small cabin with limited accommodation for passengers, some of whom had to sleep on the softer cargo in the hold. Built in NSW by E.G. Beattie and first registered there (No. 11/1875), the schooner was later sold to George J.W. Freeman and registered in Adelaide (No. 10/1877). It then traded in South Australian waters, and in September 1876 was reported as having gone aground (some references say wrecked) at Wardang Island in Spencer Gulf en route from Port Pirie to Adelaide with a cargo of flour. It was salvaged, and by 1878 was owned by W.H. Jelly. In June 1879 the Agnes was bought by Frederick Douglas and Cuthbert McKenzie, 32 shares each, and registered at Fremantle (No. 2/1879). During a storm which struck Albany on 10 September 1883 the Agnes was driven onto the jetty and the bulwarks and one of the upper planks stove in. It also ran aground near Israelite Bay on the south coast of Western Australia in May 1886, but was got off. Douglas purchased McKenzie’s shares on 10 September 1891, and then became sole owner. The Agnes was stranded once more, this time at Fanny Cove on 19 October 1891.  Again it was got off, this time with slight damage and leaking.
Captain Douglas had been hoping to sell the Agnes (which was not insured) in order to buy a larger vessel. The schooner departed Albany at 7.00 a.m. on 21 April 1892 for Bremer Bay where it anchored in John Cove, and loaded a cargo which included 40 tons of sandalwood.
THE LOSS
The Agnes had three anchors down, but on Saturday 23 April 1892 ‘a terrific sea came in, but no wind’ (telegram from Captain Douglas quoted in Albany Advertiser, 27 April 1892: 3e). So great were the seas that the schooner was burying its bows. The strain on the anchor cables and windlass was extreme, and just after midnight the cables parted, having completely pulled away the windlass. Because of its flat bottom the Agnes washed quite high up on the beach, but seas continued to break over the vessel. The crew got ashore safely, and after the seas subsided they commenced salvage on the cargo and fittings, removing everything they could onto the beach.
Captain Douglas left Bremer Bay three days later to travel overland to Albany, arriving on Thursday 28 April.  The two crew members left the wreck site by ship’s boat on the afternoon of Wednesday 27 April, and with a fair wind arrived at Albany the same afternoon as their skipper. 
INITIAL SALVAGE
The crew of the Agnes salvaged all the cargo including the sandalwood, and stripped the vessel of masts, sails ‘and everything on deck that was moveable’ (Albany Advertiser, 25 April 1892: 3a). The vessel was described as ‘breaking up fast’ (Albany Advertiser, 27 April 1892: 3e). There is a report that the wreck was purchased by John Wellstead who owned a property at Bremer Bay, and who used much of the timber for various buildings on his station. The figurehead was given by the Wellstead family to an Albany resident, and is now in the Albany Residency Museum. Some small items of rigging are held in the museum at the Wellstead homestead at Bremer Bay.
Richard McKenna stated that as a child in the 1930s he had seen the wreck of the Agnes, a substantial amount of which remained high up on the beach at that time.","NO","NSW","4","","","1.65","N","195/72, 69/72","N","N","","","18.96","","","","","71814","Brisbane Water","","Fremantle, 08/8/1879","Esperance Bremer Bay","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

"Agra","1895/07/27","Koombana Bay, close to Point MacLeod in mouth of Estuary","","","","Sunk, refloated, renamed Rose","Y","10.90","","Stock, general","","  Agra was built by N. Evensen in Norway and had a fiddle head, a square counter stern, one deck and two tiers of beams, and was owned by H. Morgenson. The vessel was insured for £8 000, and was under charter to W.R. Cave and Company of Adelaide, arriving at Fremantle from Adelaide on 14 April 1895. After unloading its cargo the barque sailed to Bunbury.
On 26 July the Agra had been in port for nearly nine weeks, but on account of the severe weather had taken on board only 462 loads of jarrah paving blocks destined for London. It had anchored off the Bunbury Jetty waiting for calmer weather so that it could again come alongside and complete loading. At this time Captain Thorson was in Fremantle on ship’s business and the mate was in charge of the vessel. On Thursday 25 July 1895 he decided to move the Agra from the safe anchorage, where it had already ridden out several blows, to the jetty to continue loading.
THE STRANDING
When the Agra moved from its anchorage the south end buoy used for manoeuvring was not available, so the mate used the barque’s kedge anchor from the starboard quarter to hold the vessel off the jetty. However the bottom in that area was only a thin layer of sand over smooth rock and, with the heavy swell then running, the kedge dragged.
The Agra was therefore hauled well away from the jetty. However around 3.00 a.m. on Friday 26 July the wind increased from the north-north-west, the vessel veered towards the shore and its stern began to strike the bottom. A wire rope was taken to a mooring buoy, but the wind and swell made it impossible to haul further out using this. With the wind increasing and the vessel continuing to strike, soundings showed 3 ft (0.9 m) of water in the hold at daylight, and by 10.00 a.m. this had increased to 6 ft (1.8 m) despite the use of both steam and manual pumps.
The mate decided that it was impossible to keep the Agra afloat, and slipped the chain. The vessel then drifted into shallow water, striking heavily all the while, until it grounded. By midnight the water in the hold had increased to 12 ft (3.7 m).
INQUIRY
A survey by a representative of the Norwegian Underwriters’ Association condemned the Agra as a wreck.
INITIAL SALVAGE
On 22 August 1895 the representative of the underwriters, Captain Gunnersen, called for tenders to discharge the cargo onto the jetty. At the same time the crew were engaged in stripping the vessel of all sails, running gear, and other fittings. It was reported that ‘nothing would be left in the ship but the lower masts’ (Inquirer, 30 August 1895: 4e).
In late 1895 the timber salvaged from the wreck of the Agra was loaded onto the Kingdom of Saxony, using John Bateman’s lighters. This ship had brought a cargo of railway lines for the Boyanup–Bunbury railway.
In March 1896 John Bateman purchased the wreck of the Agra and raised the barque with the aid of a powerful centrifugal pump. Temporarily repaired, the hull was towed to Careening Bay at Garden Island. In mid-October 1896 the barque had been fully repaired and was at anchor in Gage Roads awaiting the arrival of its new captain, a man named Garrick, before proceeding to Albany to load sandalwood for Hong Kong. Bateman had the Agra re-registered at Fremantle (No. 1 of 1897) under the new name Rose. Subsequently he sold 32 shares to Messrs Guthrie and Company of Fremantle in June 1903. The two owners later sold the barque to Chinese interests on 11 July 1905, and the Fremantle register was closed in January 1906.
The wreck of the barque Agra appears close to Point MacLeod on a chart of Bunbury Harbour Improvements, compiled in 1896. The Agra was wrecked then condemned and sold, repaired and re-registered as the ‘Rose’.","NO","Norway","","","","5.50","N","2010/0037/SG _MA-405/71","Y","N","-33.320774","","52.10","","115.647393","","","101624","Arendal","Fremantle","Tvedstrand","Bunbury","Historical Map","Protected State","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

William Garrard launched the Albatross in Geraldton as one of three vessels built from the timber of the African, which had been damaged on African reef and subsequently declared a constructive total loss at Champion Bay. Daniel Chapman dismantled the African just north of the Chapman River, and Garrard obtained some of the timbers to use in his boat building business. Albatross was built as a sailing lighter to carry cargo out to ships anchored in Champion Bay, and was licensed to operate only within the harbour limits.
THE LOSS
On 15 June 1868 the schooners Sea Bird and Twinkling Star were driven ashore by bad weather at Port Irwin. The Government Resident at Geraldton, Thomas Brown, chartered the Albatross under the command of William Garrard and sent it to Port Irwin with salvage gear and men to help the stranded schooners, despite this seeming to be contrary to its licence. The salvage was accomplished successfully and the Albatross sailed for Geraldton on 24 June with eleven crew and passengers, including a woman and a whaling team employed by John Bateman. Strong headwinds prevented the Albatross from rounding Point Moore and so it was turned to run back towards Port Irwin. About a mile off shore and almost opposite the mouth of the Irwin River, the Albatross was swamped by a large wave. The mast carried away, and everything on deck including the passengers and crew washed overboard. The vessel was then rolled over and over in the surf and fetched up on the sand-bar at the mouth of the Irwin River. Of the eleven people aboard only three survived. These were Alexander Pead, one of the crew, and two whaling crew, Edward Lewington, and Burdee, an Aborigine. Those drowned were the vessel’s builder and master, William Garrard, six whalers and the woman, Margaret Allender.
The bodies of Thomas Aaron (Eron) alias ‘Scolly’, Margaret Allender and Nabbra (Neebrow), an Aborigine, were recovered two days after the wrecking. On 29 June the body of John Bryan (Brian) was also found; however ,two more bodies recovered the day after that could not be identified. The remaining two victims were never found, although the beaches were patrolled for weeks. Those drowned but not named were ‘Moke’, an Aborigine, William Adams and William Woodward.

"ALC-40 landing barge","unknown","Swan River","","","","","Y","5.40","","","","ALC-40 is the remains of an Australian Landing Craft  originally powered by four 100hp inboard petrol engines,  used to carry vehicles and troops for beach landings. In difficulty drifting off the Western Australian coast sometime around in 1942-43, it was towed into the Swan River by the Royal Australian Navy and moored off the Torpedo Jetty, where it subsequently broke its mooring in a storm and sank in its current position 50m from shore in about 10m of water, immediately down stream from the East Fremantle Yacht Club.  After its loss, ALC-40 was stripped of all machinery. The wreck measures 18.6m long, 5.4m wide and 0.8m deep, and is reported to be a site with good visibility during an incoming tide (Scrimshaw, 1980:7)
‘In 1942 there were three models of Australian Landing Craft (ALCs). The suffix after the ALC denoted their load capacity. So an ALC40 was a 40 ton capacity Landing Craft. Two extra models were introduced in 1944.
Prior to December 1942, the smaller ALC's (32' x 38' x 44') were manufactured at the Ford Factory at Eagle Farm in Brisbane. The two smaller ALC's (ALC5 and ALC20) were built in four sections. The steel hull and the side plates were dipped in sulphuric acid and then washed in phosphoric acid before being coated with zinc chromate.
The ALCs were then assembled at Boggy Creek near Pinkenba on the northern side of the Brisbane River not far from the mouth of the river. It did not take long to realise that the ALC5 and ALC20 were not suitable for the task ahead. They lacked any adequate sea going capability, had only a range of about 70 to 10 miles, had no accommodation facilities and offered little protection in the event of a surface vessel attack. The ALC40 was devised in 1943 by cutting the ends off two ALC20's and welding them together. They were manufactured at both the Eagle Farm (Brisbane) and Corio Bay (Geelong) factories of the Ford Motor Company.’ (http://www.ozatwar.com/vehicles/alc.htm, 14/12/2015)","NO","Australia","","","","0.80","","2010/0039/SG _MA-376/77","Y","","-32.0274618167","","18.60","","115.7709814833","","","","","","","","GPS2010","Unknown","Scrimshaw, C., 1980, Swan River wrecks, Maritime Archaeology Association of Western Australia.

Carter & Co","John Kelly","Struck River Bar","N","4.00","","Sandelwood","","Alert was built in Fremantle by a member of the well-known boat-building family led by Thomas William Mews, and launched in October 1867. It had one deck and a square stern. Dickson (1996) states that Thomas built the vessel, and that the first owner was his son, John Charles Mews. Henderson (1988) gives the builder as John Charles Mews. McKenna (1959) states the first owner as John Charles Mews. In March 1868 Mews sold the cutter to William Bartram and Edward Newman (joint owners of 32 shares), and John Chester (32 shares). Newman died on 25 November 1872, and Bartram died on 23 May 1874. In both cases Ellen Newman and Barrington C. Wood, executors of the two wills, were granted probate. In August 1874 they sold the 32 shares to William Owston (Jr). Ellen Newman and Wood, trading as J. & H.C. Carter & Co. had previously bought John Chester’s 32 shares in June 1874. The cutter was not insured.
The Alert under the command of John Kelly had gone to the Mandurah jetty, inside the bar at the mouth of the Peel Inlet, to load sandalwood for shipment to Fremantle.
THE LOSS
Before he left the Mandurah Jetty Kelly sounded the bar at the mouth of Peel Inlet, and found 1.8 m of water over it. As the Alert was only drawing 1.4 m he considered it safe to sail. The wind was from the south-south-east. As the cutter sailed over the bar a heavy sea caused the after part of the keel to strike the ground very heavily. A strong current was setting out of the estuary and this, combined with the seas which broke over the vessel, caused the Alert to swing broadside on to the sea. The vessel filled with water and within one hour was a complete wreck.
INQUIRY
John Kelly held no certificate of competency and the Preliminary Court of Inquiry, although finding Kelly was to blame for the accident, did not have the power to hold a formal inquiry.
SITE LOCATION
A wreck of about the right size was located by Jack Yates in 1967 some 550 m north-east of the mouth of the Peel Inlet. This was reported to the Western Australian Museum but subsequent attempts to locate the wreck have been unsuccessful. The wreck may be either the Alert, or the Preston which was wrecked in much the same area in 1861.","NO","WA","","","","1.65","N","206/80","N","N","","","14.40","","","","","52239","Fremantle","Murray River","Fremantle","Fremantle","","Protected State","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

Brown was a 788-ton, wooden 4-masted wooden schooner built by the Globe Construction Co. in Ballard, Puget Sound, Washington, USA. Owned by the Pat Beakely Mill Co., USA and bound from Fremantle to Manila in ballast under Master Walter H. Meyers (or Myers), the schooner was blown ashore north of Perth during a gale about midnight on 29th May 1917. The tug Wyola was dispatched to attempt to tow Alex T. Brown off the beach but could not approach close enough to assist, and despite numerous attempts by the captain and crew the Alex T. Brown was unable to be refloated.
Historical significance
The wreck is significant as one of only two 4-masted schooner shipwrecks in Australia, and the place demonstrates the danger of travel by ocean in the early 20th century.
The wreck has historic value for its association with simple houses and homesteads in the Wanneroo district constructed during the early 20th century using materials salvaged from the wreck. These include the stables and mens’ quarters of Lindsay Homestead. The Lindsay family eventually burnt the wreck as they became tired of trespassers using their property to access the wreck. The wreck has been a landmark in the area since 1917 (City of Wanneroo 2016: 29-31).
Technical significance
Alex T. Brown is significant as the only example of a USA-built 4-masted wooden schooner in Australian waters, and significant as one of only two shipwrecks of 4-masted schooners in Australia, the other being the Tasmanian-built auxiliary schooner Kermandie (1920-1957).
Alex T. Brown is representative of large wooden commercial sailing vessels built during the final years of North American wooden shipbuilding. Remains of the vessel include the keel, nine sister and rider keelsons, floors and frames. Up to 12m of the keel becomes visible above the high water mark following winter storms. Further remains of the 65m vessel are likely to be buried within the fore-dune.
Interpretive/ recreational significance
Alex T. Brown is one of the only easily accessible remains of a shipwreck in the Perth metropolitan area. The wreckage lies on a beach above the high-water mark, becoming periodically exposed following winter storms and swells. The key features of ship construction are readily identifiable, and the impressive size of the timbers when fully exposed allow visitors to 
A memorial plaque has been placed on adjacent headland north of the wreck site to mark the location of the wreck and commemorate the event.","NO","USA","11","1996/08/13","","4.40","N","2009/0066/SG _MA-215/80","Y","Y","-31.5246","","65.10","","115.60505","","","200265","Ballard, Washington","Fremantle","","Puget Sound, via Manila","Aerial GIS","Not protected State","West Australian 1917/06/01

The vessel
There are three other spellings of the name of
this fishing vessel. The Elenora/Ellenora/Elleanora
was owned in 1929 by Dennis (Dinny) Ahearn.
It had been a pearling lugger and was one of the
luggers that Ahearn received as part payment for
a farm he sold in the Chapman Valley. Ahearn
acquired at least three other luggers, the Clare,
Brittania and Rosella from John Byrne at this time.
The newspaper account of the tragedy names the
ketch as the Elenora.
The crew at the time of wrecking consisted
of the skipper, Bruer (or Broer) Soolsma, a
Dutch national, Frederick Erickson (described
by the newspaper as a Swede) and James Gourley.
Soolsma had lived aboard the Alinora for the
previous 12 months and had no shore residence.
All three were from Geraldton with Gourley being
reported as a ‘well-known identity of Geraldton’
The Geraldton Guardian and Express, 1929.
The loss
The Alinora was struck by a north-west gale and
heavy rain while about 15 miles west of Port
Gregory. The vessel had not been able to make
Port Gregory before dark so was forced to beat
up and down outside waiting for daylight.
Without warning at 4.30 a.m. on 14 November
1929 the vessel was thrown on its beam ends by
a large wave, the masts touched the water and
the Alinora was swamped. The three crewmen
managed to cling to the keel until the ketch
started to sink about an hour later. James
Gourley dived under the water several times to
try to cut away the dinghy. He did not succeed,
and when he surfaced and looked for his
companions they had disappeared. Neither of
them could swim. An icebox rose to the surface
and Gourley managed to scramble onto it.
He was blown ashore about 25 km north of
Geraldton at 8.00 p.m. that night, having to
swim the last 20–30 m to the beach.
Gourley walked all night towards Geraldton
and early in the morning was given some water
by a Japanese tomato grower, his first drink since
the swamping over 24 hours previously. At 9.30
a.m. he reached the farm of a man named Hall,
who fed him and then took him into Geraldton
where he reached the Police Station a little after
11.45 a.m.
Initial salvage
Pieces of wreckage including an icebox, a dinghy,
an oar, a deck broom and some vegetables were
found on the beach during the unsuccessful
search for the bodies of the two crewmen. The
Alinora was valued at °Ã500.
Statement of significance
Social (3)
The loss of two lives as a result of the sinking of the
Geraldton based fishing boat Alinora illustrates
what must have been a fairly common situation
prior to the 1950s. Neither the skipper, Bruer
Soolsma, nor his deckhand Frederick Erickson,
could swim even though it seems likely that they
had spent a considerable time at sea. Folklore
suggests that many sailors deliberately failed
to learn to swim, preferring a quick death in
the event of their vessel sinking. The advent of
radios in small craft, the later use of EPIRBs and
the popularity of water sports such as surfing
and SCUBA diving have greatly lessened the
likelihood of such an attitude persisting.

The cutter, with three crewmen on board, had departed Hamelin Bay with a load of timber on 20 August 1895. It was insured with the China Trading Company.
This vessel should not be confused with the schooner Amy stranded in 1884.
THE LOSS
A gale struck the area on 31 August 1895 and the Amy, with the three men aboard, parted its mooring and was driven out from the anchorage at Davies Bay. The crew took to the Amy’s dinghy and managed to get to St Alouarn Island where they got ashore, and were later picked up by the barque Augusta. The abandoned cutter blew out to sea and was not seen again.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
Davies Bay, referred to by the newspaper, is not marked on any charts. It is presumed to have been locally named after M.C. Davies during his construction of the lighthouse, and was most probably the bay in which the Eva was wrecked in the same year (see entry), now known as Ringbolt Bay. The Eva was also being used during the construction of the lighthouse, and presumably both vessels would have used the same bay to discharge cargo.
The Amy is associated with the construction of the Cape Leeuwin Lighthouse, one of the most important lighthouses in Australia.

The hull was sheathed in yellow metal over felt. Built for the Liverpool to South America (Valparaiso) nitrate trade, it was initially owned by the partners John James Melhuish, Henry Winch and Robert Kent, merchants of Liverpool. By 1869 it was owned by Friend & Co., but still registered at Liverpool. Registration was later transferred from Liverpool to Melbourne, and subsequently to Newcastle, NSW, (No. 23/1883) when William A. Williams became sole owner. The Anne Melhuish had been sailed to Australia under the command of Williams’ younger brother David. The Williams brothers were among the founders of the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand, and the barque was registered at Wellington, New Zealand, in 1873 (No. 1/1873). The vessel traded mainly between Australian ports and New Zealand.
On 3 December 1883 the Anne Melhuish under the command of Captain Stonich arrived at Albany from Newcastle, NSW. Stonich handed the vessel and its cargo of 488 tons of coal to the new owners, the King George’s Sound Coal Company. The barque was then stripped down to a hulk, and the company appointed A. Robinson as caretaker.
THE LOSS
The hulk Anne Melhuish sank at its moorings in Princess Royal Harbour during the night of 23 November 1899. During the period May to October 1900 the wreck was broken up by Sergeant B.T. Goadby, an army engineer stationed at Albany, using explosives. Much of the debris was loaded aboard the hulk Saint Lawrence, which then made a number of trips under tow to the ocean outside Bald Head where the pieces were jettisoned. On 2 November 1900 a diver named Curtis arrived from Fremantle to inspect the site where the Anne Melhuish had sunk.  On receiving his report the harbour master recommended that the work cease.
During a violent storm on 23 July 1900 ‘wreckage from the sunken hulk Anne Melhuish and other old wrecks was strewn all along the foreshore’ (Albany Advertiser, 24 July 1900: 3a).
In March 1903 the dredge Governor, while working in Princess Royal Harbour, brought up debris from the harbour floor. As the Western Australian Government steamer Penguin was then in the port the opportunity was taken to use its diver. He reported finding pieces of a timber hull, considered at the time to be further remains of the Anne Melhuish. All of the largest sections were removed.","NO","UK","","","","5.33","N","195/72, 194","N","N","","","32.86","","","","","1846","Port Madoc, Wales","Albany Coal Hulk","Newcastle, NSW","","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

THE VESSEL
The Annie M. Young was built in Nova Scotia by Messrs Young and Blake for their own use. It was built of iron frames with timber being used for the keel, floors and other components. Launched in December 1863, it was fastened with iron bolts and sheathed in yellow metal. The brig was equipped with six anchors, four of which were of the Trotman design. The Annie M. Young was later sold to W. McCormick of Dublin, who was the owner in 1876.
Under the command of Samuel Tiddy the brig was in Bunbury to load ‘some long timber piles on account of Messrs. Connor & McKay’ (Herald, 4 November 1876: 3e). The cargo, some of which was apparently for Adelaide and some for New Zealand, was valued at over £1?000 and was insured, but the vessel itself was not covered by insurance. On 1 November 1876 with 220 loads of timber on board, the Annie M. Young weighed anchor and stood out for sea. It was to call at the Vasse to ‘fill up with small timber for New Zealand’ (Police records in SRO 129, file 23/911). However the wind died and the vessel was forced to anchor, but in a very exposed position.
THE LOSS
On 3 November, while Captain Tiddy was ashore, a severe gale from the north-west struck the Bunbury anchorage. The Annie M. Young had three anchors down but the severity of the gale caused all three cables to part and, at 1.00 a.m., she was driven onto the north beach about 2.8 km from the mouth of the inlet. Tiddy, according to his evidence at the inquiry, called from the shore for the crew to set the lower fore topsail and the fore topmast staysail in an endeavour to drive the brig further up into the shallows. Four days later the brig had settled 1.5 m into the sand with only 0.6 m of water at its bows and 2.1 m of water in the hold.
INQUIRY
A Court of Inquiry was held which acquitted the captain and crew of all blame.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The Annie M. Young was surveyed (at a cost to Captain Tiddy of £170) and the surveyor ordered the cargo to be discharged. A man named Sam Ward used a bullock team to pull most of the piles and sawn timber from the wreck. This timber was then re-shipped on the French barque Noveau St Michel to Wellington in New Zealand (Inquirer, 21 February 1877: 3b). However the brig itself could not be salvaged.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
TECHNICAL (2)
The composite method of building ships was developed in the middle years of the 19th century. The Annie M. Young is therefore an early example of this method of construction. Unlike most other composite vessels, although it had iron frames, the keel and floors were of timber.
Trotman anchors were designed by John Trotman and exhibited, along with many other patent anchors, at the Great Exhibition in 1851.
The stock is of iron, similar to the Admiralty anchor; the shank is rectangular in section, somewhat larger at the centre than at the ends, and is made fork-shaped at one end to receive the arms; the arms are in one piece, and are connected to the shank by a bolt passing through their centre (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1893, II: 6).
The advantage of this anchor was that when laid the arm could swivel, and the uppermost fluke would then be pulled down to lie against the shank, and therefore be less likely to foul the chain as the vessel swung at anchor. In 1852 a committee was appointed by the Admiralty to report on the efficiency of eight different anchor designs. The Trotman anchor scored the highest rating, having a 28% superiority over the standard Admiralty anchor.

The barque Arcadia, after arriving in ballast, had taken on only part of its timber cargo when a gale from the north-west, accompanied by heavy rain, blew the vessel aground at about 9.00 a.m. on the morning of 25 April 1900. Initially heavy seas prevented communication with the vessel, which had come to rest about 50 m from the south side of the Hamelin Jetty and 200 m from the shore. No lives were lost.
The Arcadia was condemned as a wreck by the underwriters. The cargo of timber was transhipped, and the wreck of the Arcadia, with all its gear, including anchors, chains, stores, &c., was sold by auction at Hamelin Bay on 13 May 1900 for £22. The purchaser, M.C. Davies, must have refloated the wreck and presumably put it on a mooring. In the morning during the storm of 22 July in which the Katinka and Lövspring were lost and the Nor’wester stranded, the Arcadia was again driven ashore and this time became a total wreck.
This was one of the most severe storms to hit the South-West, occurring three months after the Arcadia first went ashore. There were two phases to the storm—the first phase with winds from the north-north-west on 22 July, and a second phase when winds swung round to the south-west the following day. The Arcadia was lost during the first phase of this storm.
A few hours after the Arcadia was wrecked the Nor’wester during its passage towards the shore struck it, causing considerable damage to both vessels.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The salvage of the Arcadia after its first stranding is described above. After becoming a total wreck during the second storm of 22/23 July there is no further information regarding salvage.","NO","Norway","10","","","4.90","N","196/75","N","N","","","43.90","","","","","","Tvedestrand","Hamelin Bay","Risöe","Port Natal","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., (2012).

"Aristide","1889/10/25","Hamelin Bay","J. Dubigeon and Son.","Louis Coriton","Louis Coriton","Washed ashore by gale","N","8.60","","Timber",""," Aristide was built by J. Dubigeon and Son, and was sheathed with yellow metal. The owner was Louis Zaclain Coriton, who was also master of the vessel at the time it was wrecked. The barque had sailed in ballast from Fremantle to Hamelin Bay, where, on 17 October, the pilot instructed the master to anchor in 13 m of water. After discharging some of the ballast, about 30 tonnes of timber had been taken on board when the weather deteriorated. On the evening of 24 October Coriton had the crew lower the topgallant yards to reduce windage and pay out extra cable on the anchors, also attaching springs to the cables.
THE LOSS
The wind had reached gale force and the Aristide was riding to both anchors, each weighing over one tonne, when about 10.00 p.m. the port cable parted. With squalls from the west-south-west reaching hurricane force, a cable was bent to the spare anchor and it was let go. The stream anchor was also dropped. However after midnight, with the squalls continuing, the barque began dragging all three anchors. Around 2.00 a.m. on 25 October the cable of the stream anchor parted and the Aristide dragged until by 3.30 a.m. the vessel’s stern was almost in the breakers. Here the two remaining anchors held for about twenty minutes until, dragging again, the barque struck heavily 2½ miles (4.6 km) north of the Hamelin Bay Jetty. The Aristide swung broadside onto the beach about 50 m out from the high water mark, with the deck canted towards the sea. The crew scrambled for safety over the bulwarks and on to the hull.
About 4.30 a.m. the mate made an unsuccessful attempt to take a line ashore in the dinghy. The dinghy capsized, but the mate reached shore safely. When daylight came a boat from the shore was used to take a line to the Aristide and all the crew were taken to safety. Some of the crew of the barque Northern Star, then in the anchorage, were among the shore party that brought the survivors to the beach. The Aristide began to break up soon afterwards, and by 8.00 a.m. it had completely gone to pieces, wreckage being strewn along the coast for over 3 km.
INQUIRY
The Court of Inquiry, held at Hamelin on 30 October at the request of the French Consul, consisted of Dr Lepper, RM., Joseph Cookworthy, JP., and A.R. Price, clerk to the magistrates. The court found that cables had parted in a heavy gale, and that the master and crew were not to blame as Captain Coriton had taken every precaution to prevent the loss of the Aristide. Concern was expressed over the anchor chain used by the barque. It was considered by some to be too light at 1½ in (37 mm) diameter, although Captain Coriton pointed out that the vessel had been surveyed only three months earlier, with the anchors and chains being passed as of sufficient strength.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Aristide is thought to lie on the shore about 4.6 km north of the Hamelin Jetty, about 200 m north of Twin Rocks. However the wreck was so broken up by the seas that there is probably very little remaining apart from possibly the lower section of the hull.","NO","France","","","","5.00","N","196/75","N","N","","","38.30","","","","","","Nantes","Hamelin Bay","Nantes","Fremantle","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

"Arpenteur","1849/11/07","Cheynes Beach, Hassell Beach","","William Owen, John Ridley","Captain John Raines","Blown ashore in north-east gale, cargo partly salvaged","Y","5.50","","6 tuns oil, 8 tons flour, tea, sugar, sundries","BA 1034, 2619"," Arpenteur was a brig owned by William Owen and John Ridley, having been purchased in December 1847 at Port Louis, Mauritius. It had a square stern, a billet head and no galleries, and was registered at Adelaide in 1848 (No. 10/1848). It was carrying eagerly awaited mail from England which had been collected at Singapore and was to be offloaded at Fremantle. However, bad weather resulted in the brig having to bypass that port, and it headed for Albany intending to offload the mail there. On 28 September 1849 the Arpenteur tried to enter Albany harbour against a violent gale. However the bobstay broke and the vessel was driven back out to sea, well off the coast. It therefore continued on to Adelaide, arriving on 9 October. The brig was under the command of Captain John Raines with a crew of nine.
THE LOSS
The Arpenteur subsequently left Adelaide for Cape Riche with a cargo of eight tons of flour, some sugar, tea and sundry other items. It anchored off Hassell Beach in Cheyne Bay, finally offloaded the mail and began to take on whale oil from the shore whaling station. Six tuns of oil had been loaded when, on 7 November 1849, what was described as a ‘fearful gale’ (Perth Gazette, 23 November 1849: 2b) from the north-east drove it ashore and the Arpenteur became a total wreck. All the crew were saved, but ‘only one or two articles of the cargo had been saved, and Mr Owen appears to be uncertain whether either that or the vessel was insured’ (ibid.).
INQUIRY
There is no record of an official inquiry being held, but a newspaper reported that on 11 November 1849 surveyors had left Albany for Cheyne Bay to make a preliminary examination of the wreck of the Arpenteur. It was ‘considered advisable to sell everything for the benefit of all parties concerned’ (Perth Gazette, 23 November 1849: 2b).
INITIAL SALVAGE
The wreck of the Arpenteur was sold for £11, and ‘the flour part of her cargo, somewhat damaged, realised £5 a ton’ (Perth Gazette, 14 December 1849: 2c). The purchaser of the wreck was Mr Thomas, and his purchase included a tun of oil.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Arpenteur lies about 100 metres off shore at the west end of Hassel Beach in Cheyne Bay. The Arpenteur and the brigantine Wave (see entry) were of a very similar size and construction, and with similar cargoes from the same port. They were wrecked in the same area within 16 months of each other, which has made positive identification of the wreck difficult.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck of the Arpenteur was inspected in late 1972 by Graeme Henderson, Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum, and lies in about 3 m of water on a flat sandy bottom. There are several frames and about 4.6 m of planking, all in good condition, showing above the sand. The planking bears traces of having been coppered. Some rounded stone ballast is also present on the site.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
There have been some artefacts recovered from the wreck of the Arpenteur. These include the lead draught numerals, 5, 6 and 7, yellow metal sheathing tacks, copper fastenings, iron spikes, treenails and some samples of wood taken from timbers dragged ashore by Charles Westerberg.","NO","Mauritius","","1975/05","","3.20","","2009/0071/SG _MA-357/77","Y","Y","-34.869779","","22.00","","118.40373","","3.00","","Seychelles","Adelaide, Cape Riche","Adelaide","Mauritius","Aerial GIS","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

The first owner in Australia was Henry Simpson of Adelaide who registered it at that port in 1872 (No. 10/1872). In 1884 it was again registered at Adelaide (No. 10/1884), this time by Simpson Bros & Partners; the brothers being J.L. and W.A. Simpson. McIllwraith McEacharn & Co. Ltd bought the Athena in 1896, and after registering it at Adelaide (No. 12/1896) converted it to a hulk. In 1898 it was taken to Albany for use as a coal hulk.
THE LOSS
After stripping the hulk of all useful items the Athena was towed to a position between Ledge and Herald points, east of Gull Rock, and there set on fire.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck thought to be that of the Athena lies in the western corner of a small bay a little over a kilometre north-west of Herald Point.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck of the Athena lies in 2 m of water in the surf zone at roughly 90º and 30 m out from the base of the cliff. The site consists of substantial timber remains including the stem, breast hook and windlass barrel together with a number of metal knees and fastenings. There is also a mound of chain and two hawse pipes. The planking is about 28 by 9 cm, the frames 31 by 27 cm, and the wood appears to be in good condition. The fastenings are of both metal and wood (treenails).
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
During fieldwork carried out by Maritime Archaeology Graduate Diploma students in 1990 samples of timber from the wreck were taken and analysed, and proved to be from American elm, Ulmus Americana. An analysis of a treenail from the wreck showed it to be made from black locust, Robinia pseudoacacia.","NO","UK","","1974/12/07","","5.09","N","2009/0072/SG _MA-13/80","Y","Y","-35.026165","","39.93","","118.016159","","","56081","Newcastle on Tyne, South Shields, Northumberland","","Port Adelaide","","GPS position suspect","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

It had two decks, a billet head and a square stern. Baker (1973) refers to the vessel as a brig, and it is possible that it was originally built with such a rig, a third (mizzen) mast being added at a later date. Like many of the whalers of the time it was owned by a consortium, in this case of eleven men. There is no depth known for the hull specifications, but there is a figure of 13 feet (4 m) for the draft. On 21 August 1841 the ship sailed from New London, USA, under the command of Captain Gilbert Pendleton (referred to as Pindleton in the Launceston Examiner) with a crew of 24. Two of the crew were listed as Indians, three were Negroes. Their destination was the Indian Ocean, and a year later they had secured 800 barrels of whale oil.
THE LOSS
The Avis was anchored in Two People Bay taking on water and wood when, during the night, a gale struck from the south-east. Both cables parted and the ship was driven ashore becoming a complete wreck, the crew all reaching shore safely. Much of the wreck (a newspaper reported two-thirds) was quickly buried by sand.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The 800 barrels of black oil were saved. The wreck of the Avis, the oil and some tobacco were sold at a public auction in Albany, and fetched £850. There appears to be no record of how much, if any, of the ship was subsequently salvaged. On 14 September 1842 the Government Resident at Albany wrote to the Colonial Secretary querying whether the dutiable goods within the wreck, such as the tobacco, should be charged duty at a different rate to the duty to be paid on the wreck itself.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
Some years ago a figurehead was reported as having been seen wedged in rocks at the north-east end of Two People Bay, and in 1986 a large wooden knee was also found. In 1989 a wreck inspection by Graeme Henderson of the Western Australian Museum recovered a plank with some treenails. No other remains of the Avis have so far been found. Although stated as having been quickly buried by sand after going ashore, the beach in this area is subject to considerable erosion during storms. This erosion may have destroyed or re-distributed any remaining timbers and artefacts.","NO","USA","25","","","","N","195/72","N","N","","","30.35","","","","","","Bath, Maine","New London","New London","Indian Ocean whaling grounds","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

John Bateman of Fremantle purchased the vessel on 2 June 1900, when it was then first registered at Fremantle (No. 11/1900). There were a number of subsequent Western Australian owners. Awhina Steamship Co. Ltd bought it in December 1904, selling it to Swan River Shipping Co. Ltd in 1909. In late 1917 it was sold by McIlwraith, McEarchan and Company Proprietary, Ltd to Alexander Armstrong and George Waters (joint owners) in Albany. They sold it to Ernest McGregor Christie ten years later. The last owners were Francis Lesley Eliot, Clem Douglas and Alex Armstrong (jnr) all of Albany who bought the Awhina on 5 June 1928. In 1930 the original worm eaten rudder was replaced by a locally-built one of jarrah.
THE LOSS
In 1936 at the end of its economically useful life the Awhina was sold for £50 to J. Hall, a scrap metal merchant of Fremantle. It was alongside the town jetty at Albany being stripped when it sank in about 4 m of water. The engines had been dismantled and either water entered through the propeller shaft hole, or where a seacock had been left open or had failed.
INITIAL SALVAGE
A diver went down and plugged the leak on the Awhina and it was pumped out by the Bonthorpe, another steam tug. After being put on a mooring and the remaining salvaged parts taken off, the tug was towed by the Bonthorpe to the bay just west of Ledge Point and inshore from Gull Rock. On 19 April 1936 it was beached and set on fire. The boiler and parts of the hull can still be seen.
The steering wheel from Awhina (not the original, but one from a sailing ship) was salvaged by Les Douglas and is on loan to the Albany Residency Museum, as are some other items.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Awhina lies close to the shore in the bay just west of Ledge Point and inshore from Gull Rock. It is best located by the boiler projecting above the level of the sea.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck of the Awhina lies in 2-4 m of water with the single ended return tube boiler extending about 1 m above sea level. The boiler is subject to rolling movement in the waves. The timber which was below the level of the sea at the time the tug was burned also remains on site. The close spacing of the frames is noteworthy. This was a necessary strengthening feature in a tug. Some planking, ceiling and the associated fastenings remain, as does some of the copper sheathing. The boiler appears to have been supported on large timbers which are partly visible beneath it. A water tank lies 50 m from the stern. The propeller shaft bearing still retains the lignum vitae lining.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
During the 1990 survey of the wreck of the Awhina by the Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum, four fastenings and a section of metal rail were recovered for analysis.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
When the 9 000 tons of coal on board the steamer Castlemoor caught fire in September 1928 the Awhina was used to put the fire out. This took some six or seven days of pumping water into the steamer’s holds, and prevented the total loss of the ship (see entry). This was only one of several fires on board ships that were fought by the Awhina during its period at Albany.
During World War I as the Australian Expeditionary Force vessels were collecting at Albany, Awhina was kept busy as it was one of the few tugs available to service the needs of the fleet.
SOCIAL (3)
The Awhina had a ship’s whistle with a distinctive sound. For many years of its working life this whistle (said to sound more like a siren) was used to summon on duty lumpers needed to work the hulks and bunker visiting steamers. It must have been a sound very familiar to the people of Albany.
INTERPRETIVE (6)
The remains of the Awhina are clearly visible and easily accessible so have the potential to provide public education through interpretive signage.
RARE (7)
The Awhina is the only New Zealand-built, 19th century tug in the area covered by this book.

Awhina was a 136 tonne wooden screw steam tug, owned by Swan River Shipping Co. Ltd., Perth. It was built by Hector Macquarrie in Auckland, New Zealand in 1884 and registered at Fremantle in 1900. Awhina was a strongly built working vessel and after working in the New Zealand timber trade was sold to owners in Newcastle, NSW where it became part of a fleet of 11 tugs. In 1900 it arrived in Fremantle where it again worked as a tug during the week, and a pleasure cruise boat on the weekends!
The Awhina came to Albany in 1912 where it spent the remainder of its working life in the harbour as a tug towing vessels in and out of port, towing hulks out to sea to be sunk, towing floats for gunnery target practice and supplying the Eclipse Island lighthouse.
On 19 April 1936, Awhina was towed out of the harbour and burnt off Gull Rock at Ledge Bay, near Albany.","NO","NZ","4","1991","","3.10","50 Sc. built by Bowen McLauchlin and Coy, Paisley, Scotland","2010/0030/SG _MA-195/72","Y","Y","-35.0143013833","","30.50","","118.0040418667","","2.00","87528","Auckland","","Fremantle","","GPS 2005","Not protected State","Worsley P. & J.

"Azelia","1887","Cossack, Butcher Inlet","","Manning and McRae","","Unseaworthy","N","5.50","","None","","The 85-ton schooner Azelia (Official Number 61103), which had been trading out of Fremantle since 1871, suffered a number of mishaps during the early 1880s. In 1882, the vessel was purposely beached at Fremantle after parting its moorings. The owners, Marmion and McRae, decided later in the year that the vessel `which had proved so unfortunate on various occasions’, should be thoroughly repaired and fitted up for the pearling trade. By January 1883, the work was completed and, with Captain Brown, formerly of ELIZA BLANCHE in charge, the vessel was ready to load for the north-west.
On the 1 March Azelia set sail for Cossack, but was once again unfortunate, for about the 25th of the month the schooner ran onto a spit at the Fortescue River, straining itself badly, and carrying away the false keel. It was safely floated and after temporary repairs, was sent to Singapore to be completely repaired. In November of that year the Collector of Customs reported that the Azelia was trading between Cossack and Singapore.
Either the schooner suffered another, unreported, mishap during the following two years, or it simply became increasingly difficult to maintain in a seaworthy state. In 1885 it was sold as a wreck at Cossack to Bryan & Co, but in 1889 when the remains needed to be removed, no owners could be traced. The vessel was subsequently removed with explosives.

It was valued at £300, and insured for £250 with the Commercial Union Assurance Company Ltd, while the cargo was insured with the Phoenix Insurance Company. The weather on 19 and 20 June had been ‘exceedingly boisterous’ (West Australian, 22 June 1900: 5a), with some widespread very strong gales. Newspapers reported that the storms had been so bad that the ship Canada (2 318 tons), bound from Melbourne to Manilla, had to be towed into Fremantle after losing its main topgallant mast, mizen mast, and a number of sails, and having five of the crew, including the captain and chief officer, injured.
THE LOSS
During a lull in the gales the Ballarat was taking a cargo of 450 railway sleepers to the barque Sidney, anchored in Koombana Bay. During this time a heavy squall struck, blowing away the lighter’s sails. The anchor was quickly dropped, but it did not dig in and the vessel was blown towards the shore until, just before dark, the anchor at last held. The crew pumped the Ballarat dry, and then left for the shore in a small boat, being nearly swamped in the process. In the early hours of 21 June another gale washed the lighter ashore, only 100 m from the wreck of the Carbet Castle, and it there broke up.","NO","Unknown","3","","","","N","405/71","N","N","","","","","","","","","","Bunbury","","","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

On 4 June 1629 the ship struck a reef near Beacon Island  in the Houtman Abrolhos. Of the 322 aboard 40  drowned and the  rest got ashore.  In search of water and food Jacobsz, Pelsaert and others left site in a 30-foot (9.1 m) longboat (a replica of which has also been made)  and  in being unsuccessful  sailed for Batavia, now known as Jakarta.  Soon after their arrival in Batavia Pelsaert was sent in the Jacht  Sardam to  recover the bullion  and to rescue the  survivors.  In his absence a murderous mutiny  occurred led by  Jeronimus Cornelisz.
In the period 1970 through to 1974, under the leadership of   Jeremy Green of the Western Australian Museum, some of the cannon from the Batavia wreck, an anchor and many artifacts were salvaged, including timbers from the port side of the stern of the ship. These were then conserved by the Museum's conservation laboratories under the leadership of Colin Pearson and his successors Neil North and Ian MacLeod and  Ian Godfrey and Vicki Richards.   In order to facilitate the monitoring and any future treatment the hull timbers were erected on a steel frame designed and erected by Geoff Kimpton, a member of Green's staff. The design, and that of a stone arch, or portico, which was also raised form the seabed, is such that individual components can be removed for treatment without affecting those adjacent, or the exhibit as a whole.  A replica of the Batavia was built at the Bataviawerf (Batavia Wharf) in Lelystad in the Netherlands and was launched in 1995 under master-shipbuilder Willem Vos.  A replica of the longboat was also constructed and is presently on exhibition at the WA Museum in Geraldton.

"Batoe Bassi","1880/06/31","Inshore Island","","","Captain B. H. Buir","Stranded","Y","7.56","","Sugar and coconuts","BA 1059","The Batoe Bassi had been built in Norway, but by 1880 was under Dutch registration, with (probably) Dutch officers and Indonesian crew. Even though referred to as ‘Malays’ at the time, this was a generic term used to describe seamen from many areas of South East Asia.
There are a number of different tonnages given for the Batoe Bassi: Henderson (1988) states 293, the Inquirer (9 June 1880) quotes two different tonnages in the two articles in that edition – 325 and 400. All these figures may be correct, depending on which “tonnage” the writers were basing their figures. The vessel has also been referred to as a barque (Henderson, 1988) and as a brig (West Australian, 29 June 1880: 3b).
On 30 April 1880 the Batoe Bassi had sailed from Tjilitjap in Java for Melbourne. The barque was under the command of Captain B.H. Buir, with a crew of A. Brinkmann, first mate, A.J. Fischer, second mate, and 20 Malays. Also on board were three women, wives of three of the Malay crewmen. The cargo consisted of 300 tons of sugar, 3 000 coconuts, some rice and spirits.
On 14 May when about 700 nautical miles west of Carnarvon the Batoe Bassi was struck by a heavy gale. With seas breaking over the deck it was found necessary to work the pumps every two hours to keep the water from rising in the hold. Another gale struck the vessel on 22 May, and the crew had to man the pumps hourly. This gale ‘continued without abatement until noon of the 25th May, when the wind further increased, and the pumps had to be kept going constantly’ (West Australian, 29 June 1880: 2c). The crew fell ill from the constant labour at the pumps, and at 9.00 p.m. one died. The seas continued breaking over the vessel, and the monkey rail was washed away. At noon on 28 May the sailors came aft, complaining that they could not pump any more. Six of them were incapacitated by cold and rheumatism, while the leak and gale were still increasing. By this time the barque was over 190 miles south of Esperance at latitude 37.04º S and longitude 122.03º E. Captain Buir consulted with his officers and decided to bear away for the nearest land to find an anchorage and assistance. The Batoe Bassi sailed north by west towards the coast.
THE LOSS
Captain Buir gave a detailed explanation of the disaster to a Perth newspaper, part of which is given here:
Lat.35.08 S.; Long. 121.27 E. (by dead reckoning): On the 29th, at 2 p.m. made land, and laid to, until 4 a.m., on the 30th, when we again ran for the land. More of the crew, at this time, fell sick. The weather moderated, but the sea was running high, and the ship was sinking, the crew being unable to keep the leak down. With much difficulty managed to navigate the ship between the islands, and at 5 p.m. anchored under Inshore Island, in four fathoms of water (West Australian, 29 June 1880: 2c).
The captain and mate went ashore to get assistance, but there was none available so they returned to the vessel. Another crewman died, and the rest were too sick to pump. The following day (31 May 1880) there was 1.7 m of water in the hold ‘and no assistance procurable, slipped her anchor and ran her on the beach, in hopes of saving part of the cargo, and possibly the ship’ (West Australian, 29 June 1880: 2c). The vessel grounded in 13 feet (4 m) of water. The crew were landed, and some provisions taken ashore together with two sails to make a shelter.
At 4.00 p.m. an employee of the Overland Telegraph Line arrived and informed the captain that the nearest place where assistance could be procured was Albany. He also told them that there was a telegraph station some 70 miles away at Esperance Bay. The mate was immediately sent there to telegraph to Albany for assistance.
The following three days (1, 2 & 3 June) the wind blew strongly from the south causing heavy surf. On 2 June the deck disappeared under water. According to a statement by Captain Buir published in the West Australian of 29 June, the mate returned from Esperance on 4 June with the news that the Western Australian Government was sending the Agnes (see entry) from Albany to provide assistance to the survivors. A telegraph operator with a field instrument arrived on that same day to enable Captain Buir to communicate with the government.
There is a report in another newspaper, the West Australian of 4 June, which gives a slightly different slant on the reason for sending the telegraph operator to the wreck site. When first approached with a request to go to the aid of the stricken Batoe Bassi the owner of the schooner Agnes, Fred Douglas, was willing, but only if paid £100. The mate of the Batoe Bassi, Brinkmann, was not prepared to take it upon himself to accept the conditions without reference to his captain. It was to avoid any unnecessary delay in communication between Captain Buir, the Batoe Bassi’s consignees in Melbourne, and the owner of the Agnes, that the Government had a telegraph assistant and field instrument from Esperance sent to the scene of the wreck.
It was not until 6 June that the weather moderated sufficiently for some of the crew to board the Batoe Bassi. Sails were taken from the sail locker, as well as more provisions and crew’s clothing. These and the sails from the yards were loaded into the longboat. This, however, capsized in the surf and most of its cargo was lost, the little that was saved being ‘much damaged’. Meanwhile the barque was ‘working into the sand’. The Agnes arrived on 9 June, and the men brought from Albany immediately set to work to strip the Batoe Bassi and save all they could, the spars being landed on Inshore Island. The following day the wind blew hard from the south-east, the vessel fell over on its side and began to quickly break up. 
INITIAL SALVAGE
There appears to have been little salvaged from the Batoe Bassi. A newspaper quoting its correspondent in Albany reported:
The schooner Agnes, which left here on the 5th inst., with a number of men to go to Taguer harbour, to the assistance of the Dutch brig Batoe Bassi, returned on the 18th instant, with the officers and crew of that ill-fated vessel, which has become a total wreck, everything having been lost except her sails and part of her rigging (West Australian, 29 June 1880: 3b).
The above article is not quite correct as Constable Peirl, who sailed on the Agnes to the wreck site, reported that he had secured six cases of gin and one of sherry, and that the luggage belonging to the crew had also been saved (Dickson, 2012: 107).
Thomas Sherratt’s schooner Walter & Mary was also involved in the salvage of some of the ship’s gear as he had bought the wreck for £8 at an auction conducted by W.J. Gillam in Albany on 30 June 1880. The ship’s gear, including two complete sets of sails, ropes, chains and boats from the vessel fetched very little at the auction.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Batoe Bassi lies 300 m east of Alexander Point, and about 45 m from the shore. The area is subject to considerable movement of the sand around the wreck due to wave and current action.
Note: Two contemporary newspaper reports place the wreck at Taguer Harbour. The Inquirer and Commercial News of 18 February 1880 quotes the Government Gazette’s description of this harbour:
Taguer Harbour – The coast from Duke of Orleans Bay trends about east 17 miles to Taguer harbour, with several islands and sunken reefs between; tolerably close in shore appears to be the clearest passage, and anchorages can be obtained should the wind fail. Taguer harbour is formed by a high bluff extending in a southerly direction about one mile. The anchorage is on the east side of this bluff in 6 fathoms, white sand, with the extremes of the bluff bearing S.S.E.
A contemporary Perth newspaper reporting the loss of the Batoe Bassi at Taguer Harbour described this as ‘a small boat inlet used by Mr Campbell Taylor for shipping his wool and stores’ (Inquirer, 9 June 1880: 3b).
British Admiralty chart 1059 shows Tagon Bay 17 miles east of Duke of Orleans Bay, sheltered on its western side by a high point of land projecting southwards, and which was presumably originally named Taguer. However, the wreck of the Batoe Bassi has been found some seven miles west of this bay, so in 1880 there must have been some confusion in the description of the location of the wreck.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck of the Batoe Bassi lies in shallow water on a sandy bottom. The wreck, which projects in parts above the sea bed some 1-1.5 m, is approximately 47 m long and 7.6 m wide. The keel is on an axis of 98º, starboard side towards the beach, and bow pointing slightly shorewards. There is a slight list to starboard. The lower section of the hull remains in situ with planking frames and ceiling, bronze fastened. The timber is in good condition due to the protection of the anaerobic sediment only 20 cm below the sea bottom. There is some wire standing rigging, parcelled, served and coated with tar, with wooden deadeyes still attached. Reports state that more rigging lies buried in sand on the beach.
There are two heaps of anchor chain near the bow, and a small wooden capstan. A wreck inspection in 1969 by Harry Bingham of the Western Australian Museum also found part of the deck with some ringbolts still in place. There were also the remains of part of the cargo of coconuts, still in woven baskets.
An anchor previously found 10 m seaward of the bow, and standing vertically in the sand, was missing when the site was inspected in March 1982 by staff from the Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
Two of the finders of the wreck of the Batoe Bassi recovered a variety of artefacts including two bronze spikes, two lengths of wire standing rigging, a deadeye, an iron belaying pin and some timber.
During a further wreck inspection in February 1992 by Dr Michael McCarthy of the Western Australian Museum samples of fastenings, timber and a ringbolt from the section of deck were recovered. The Esperance Museum is in possession of a white porcelain basin from the wreck of the Batoe Bassi.

William Murray and Edward Howson built the Bay at Fremantle in 1909. It was carvel built with a straight stem, a counter stern and one deck. William Murray and his uncle Edward Howson had formed a shipbuilding partnership in 1903 in Beach Street, Fremantle, where this schooner was built. The joint owners of the vessel were John Byrne, pearler of Broome, and Martin Freeney, commercial traveller of Perth.

"Bee","1851/05/08","Cape Bouvard","Posibly Mr James Woodward Turner of Augusta","Mr Turner (possibly of Augusta)","","","N","","","Flour, barley, potatoes","","Bee was built at Augusta by James Woodward Turner and his youngest son, James Augustus Turner, in 1848. The Turners had arrived in Western Australia on the Warrior in 1830 and settled in Augusta. No record of the schooner’s registration has been found, though Turner had registered his previous vessel the Alpha. No dimensions are known apart from that of 17 tons burthen. A newspaper report prior to the launching of the schooner had indicated a size of 22 tons burthen:
…engaged in building a very fine little vessel of 22 tons burthen. She is nearly completed and the requisite steps will be taken to procure her registration from the Local Government during next month (Inquirer, 8 December 1847: 3b).
However in January 1849 the newspaper announcement of the arrival of the Bee at Fremantle on its maiden voyage noted the tonnage as being about 17 tons burthen. The term ‘burthen’ was, even in 1851, an old fashioned word describing the vessel’s carrying capacity, and originally referred to the number of tuns of wine that a vessel could carry in its hold.
After being twice stranded at the Vasse in 1849 and 1850 (see entry), the younger James Turner had sold his share in the Bee to John Salkild. In May 1851 the schooner was carrying a cargo consisting of five tons of flour belonging to William Pearce Clifton, three tons of potatoes and 50 bushels of barley from Thomas Salkild (John’s brother) and 100 bushels of barley from James McCourt, on a voyage to Fremantle The flour was for the Commissariat at Fremantle, the prevailing price of flour being £18 per ton. While the younger Turner was normally in command, on this voyage Thomas Salkild was acting as master.
THE LOSS
On 7 May the Bee had been attempting to approach Garden Island on its way to Fremantle. The weather being against it, the vessel was compelled to turn about and head back south. A heavy sea destroyed the binnacle, rendering the compass useless. At about 1.30 a.m. on 8 May the schooner was in the breakers off Cape Bouvard (spelt Bouvarde in the newspaper). Passing through these without striking, it went ashore on a sandy beach. Some six days later the vessel was described as ‘full of water, and perfectly whole, but from the situation in which she is placed, it is supposed she will not be again afloat’ (Inquirer, 14 May 1851: 3b).
INITIAL SALVAGE
Nearly all the flour was saved as the seawater had only penetrated a very small distance into the sacks. This would confirm that the Bee went ashore as stated in the newspaper rather than having sunk off the coast, so that salvage of the partially ruined flour was possible.
SITE LOCATION
A wreck inspection carried out by the Western Australian Museum in May 1995 on a wreck on Bouvard Reef reported that the material may have come from either the Bee or the Lass of Geraldton, both lost in this vicinity. The GPS position of the wreckage examined is 32° 50.492 S and 115° 35.166 E, almost ten miles south of Cape Bouvard. However as the newspaper report of 14 May 1851 (above) indicates that the Bee went ashore on a sandy beach, this would seem to preclude the Bee as being the wreck inspected in 1995, which was nearly three miles offshore.

"Belinda","1824/06/17","Middle Island, Recherche Archipelago","","J. Lee","Thomas Coverdale","","Y","","","Sealing","AUS 119","Belinda was built at Yarmouth with one deck, copper fastened and with iron knees. No dimensions apart from the tonnage are known, but it was stated as having a draught of 13 ft (3.96 m) when fully loaded. It was owned by J. Lee and was under the command of Captain Thomas Coverdale with a crew of 25. The brig was armed with two guns. The Belinda had arrived at Hobart on 12 November 1823 after a disastrous voyage from England, during which it suffered a considerable amount of damage. Both masts were lost, the galley and boats swept away by boarding seas, and two seamen and a boy were drowned. However, the cook who had gone overboard when the galley was washed away was saved. The subsequent repairs took three months. After being repaired the Belinda sailed to Sydney. On 17 May 1824 the Belinda under command of Thomas Coverdale and with John Hassell as mate departed that port for the south coast of Western Australia to hunt for seals.
THE LOSS
The exact circumstances into the wrecking of the Belinda in Goose Island Bay are not known. The newspaper reported:
We are sorry to announce the loss of the brig Belinda, Captain Coverdale, which vessel sailed from hence for the seal fishery, in Bass’s Streights [sic], on the 17th May last. On the 18th of July last this fine brig was unfortunately stranded on Middle Island, one of the archipelago of Recherche to the Westward of New Holland. Providentially the captain, officers, supercargo, and crew, were saved – with a poor supply of provisions or stores, the whole of which were nearly lost. Having preserved two of the boats, an attempt was made to reach Sydney from the wreck, but, after proceeding nearly 200 miles, one of the boats swamped near the shore. They then came to the determination, as the denier resource, of making back to the place from whence they started, attended by the remaining boat. The Nereus being fortunately out sealing in that direction, fell in with our hapless countrymen, when reduced to the utmost distress in the absence of provisions, which was all consumed – having, for a long time, been existing on an allowance so scanty as scarcely to admit of prolongation of life – but a Gracious Providence has delivered them! (Sydney Gazette, 17 March 1825: 2d).
As reported the crew got ashore safely, and on 8 December were picked up by the brig Nereus (Captain Thomas Swindells), also sealing along the south coast, and taken to Sydney. They arrived in Sydney in early March 1825, the Nereus having collected 3 500 seal skins at Kangaroo Island on the voyage eastwards. On 15 March 1825 Captain Swidells wrote to the Colonial Secretary, Frederick Golbourn, in Sydney:
I beg leave to acquaint you that on the 8th of December last at Middle Island on the South West Coast of New Holland I took off Twenty Six British Subjects being the late Crew of the Brig Belinda, Thos. Coverdale Master – which Brig was totally wrecked on the said Island – and I enclose you a Certificate of having Victualled and brought the said Crew to Sydney – and request that you will be pleased to direct the usual remuneration to be paid for such Service.
On 12 April the Colonial Secretary authorised the payment after requesting and receiving a ‘nominal return’ of the crew on board the Nereus, together with their dates of joining and discharge from the vessel.
Four weeks after landing in Sydney Captain Coverdale boarded a ship (the Hope), which sailed on 29 March for England.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The following year the schooner Liberty (40 tons, Captain Young) returned to Sydney from a sealing expedition with 1 500 fur seal skins and two tons of salt. It also had on board some copper, iron and two of the anchors salvaged from the wreck of the Belinda. These latter items were subsequently sold at auction. The salt most probably had been obtained from the salt lake on Middle Island for use in preserving the skins.
In 1989 small traces of what had been molten lead were noted during a wreck inspection by staff of the Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum, and it was considered that the crew of the Liberty may have partly burnt the hull of the wreck in an attempt to salvage some of the metal hull fastenings.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Belinda was discovered in 1989 by Graeme Henderson during the Museum expedition. The wreck lies at the eastern end of the sandy beach on the north side of Middle Island, some 30 m from the shore in 3–4 m of water on a sand bottom.
SITE DESCRIPTION
In 1989, a 12 m by 6 m section of part of one side of the hull was visible lying in 3 m of water, with the lower section coppered and the upper hull covered with sacrificial pine boards. The position of the timbers shows that the wreck had come to rest with the keel shoreward and the deck facing the sea.
A wreck inspection in 2001 by maritime archaeologists from the Museum found no indications of any timber remains of the Belinda, but two concretions were noted. It was considered that the timbers had been covered by sand, a condition that appears to happen frequently at this site.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
In 1989 a number of artefacts were collected by maritime archaeologists from the wreck of the Belinda, including copper pennies, musket balls, cannon balls, copper sheathing, timber samples, rigging fragments including rope and pulleys, clay pipes, shoes, buttons, glass bottles, and various other items.","NO","UK","28","2002/05","","4.00","N","2009/0074/SG _MA-12/90","Y","Y","-34.09009","","","","123.21031","","","","Yarmouth","Sydney","Yarmouth","Sealing grounds at Recherche Archipelago","*Check position WGS84","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

It was renamed the Ben Dearg in 1936 and in 1939 the UK Admiralty requisitioned the Ben Dearg as a minesweeper in World War II. The Ben Dearg arrived in Albany in 1949 with its sister ship Commiles, both owned by the Anglo-Australian Fishing Company. The trawlers were employed in trawling the Great Australian Bight, but the venture was unsuccessful.  In 1951 the Ben Dearg was scuttled off Swarbrick’s Beach east of Albany in an area today known as Ben Dearg Beach, while the Commiles was sunk in the Rottnest Island Ships’ Graveyard in 1953 after being used for target practice by the RAAF.","NO","UK","","","","3.90","triple expansion steam engine","2010/0030/SG _MA-195/72","Y","N","-35.010441964","","38.30","","118.051665562","","","144518","Beverley","","Fleetwood","","Position from Harbour Master Report","Not protected Federal","SRO 729/55  13/8/56 Harbour master Albany 13/8/56 includes sketch of position.

"Ben Ledi","1879/12/16","Abrolhos Islands, Pelsaert Islands","Barclay, Curle and Co of Glasgow","","Captain John Boyd","Always visible","Y","10.50","","Ballast","AUS332"," Ben Ledi was built by Barclay, Curle and Company at Glasgow, under Special Survey and of heavier plating than Lloyd’s rules then required. It was fitted with two decks and one bulkhead and was insured for £13 000. The owners were Watson Brothers of Glasgow. The draught of the vessel on this voyage was 13 ft 6?in aft and 13 ft 4 in forward.
THE LOSS
The Ben Ledi, under the command of John Boyd with a crew of 22, was en route from Sydney to Calcutta in ballast when it struck on the east side of Pelsaert Island at 11 p.m. on the night of 16 December 1879. Captain Boyd had taken a noon sight that day which he calculated to place the ship at latitude 30º 8' south and longitude 114º 15' east. From this position he estimated that the south end of Pelsaert Island bore NW magnetic, and about 70 miles away. The Ben Ledi was steered on a course N by EE magnetic for four hours from the noon position, covering 24 miles. A further 16 miles on a more northerly course was covered up to 7 p.m. At that time Captain Boyd had estimated his position as being about 42 n miles from the coast and 19 n miles south-west of Pelsaert Island. He changed course to NW by W, which he judged would take him well clear of the Houtman Abrolhos. The wind was from the south-west and the sea smooth. Because of the smooth sea Captain Boyd had made no allowance for leeway. He had no deviation card aboard and stated that, to the best of his knowledge, the compass aboard the Ben Ledi had not been swung in the 4 years he had been master.
After striking the reef the vessel was found to be making no water but, having hit at a speed of 9?knots, it was well and truly fast on the rock shelf, the bow being in only 6 ft (1.83 m) of water despite drawing 13 ft 6 in (4 m). This gives an indication of the force with which it struck. At daylight the crew went ashore, taking with them some sails to make tents, and some provisions. On the morning of 19 November, having failed to get his vessel off the reef, Captain Boyd, with five men, left for Geraldton in one of the ship’s boats to seek assistance.
INQUIRY
A court of inquiry held at Geraldton on 8 January 1880 before Maitland Brown, Acting Principal Officer of Customs for Champion Bay, Lockier Burges, J.P. and John Craig, Master of the Rob Roy, acting as nautical assessor, exonerated Captain Boyd from blame over the loss of the Ben Ledi as it considered that adverse and unknown currents had taken the ship to the east of its estimated position. Captain Boyd stated his explanation for the wrecking as being either a strong current, or excessive mirage affecting his sextant sights of the sun. During the inquiry comment was made of the Marten having been wrecked at the identical place the previous year.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The Ben Ledi was sold by public auction held at the warehouse of Gale and Monger in Geraldton on 9 January 1880 for £80 to a consortium, which included Charles Crowther. As the vessel was in ballast, salvage must have been mainly of ship’s fittings. The cutter Moonlight needed several trips to convey this material to Geraldton.
The price paid at auction compared with the insurance value gives an indication that there seemed to be little hope of getting the vessel off, and of how difficult it was going to be to salvage any worthwhile material.
SITE LOCATION
The Ben Ledi lies just offshore on the east side of Pelsaert Island about 7 km north of Wreck Point. This is also the site of the wreck of the schooner Marten in 1878.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck of the Ben Ledi consists of the main site about 150 m off shore on a shelving reef in 2–6 m of water, with much material washed shoreward. This latter is in breaking water in depths of from 0.5–1.5 m. Some frames and plating at the main site show above water. The bulk of the wreckage covers an area about 33?m long, and there is still further material about 20 m to the north of the main site. The spread of heavy pieces of iron hull over a fairly large area gives an indication of the strength of the seas that can impact on this section of the reef. The bows have disintegrated, but sections of plating and frames, anchors, chain, windlass, deck and mast fittings and ballast stone are visible. The stern section with the rudder lies at the greatest depth. The inshore area contains a section of the ship’s floor, some deck beams and a section of bulwark.
There is also a land site where the survivors camped while awaiting rescue. Previously this had been the site of the camp of the survivors from the wreck of the Marten, so it is difficult to differentiate material from the two crews. Guano workers on the island, fishermen and souvenir hunters have removed or disturbed much evidence of the campsites.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
A section of the poop of the wreck of the Ben Ledi with mizzen mast dead-eyes still attached, was cut free by archaeologists from the Maritime Museum and taken to Fremantle for conservation and possible later display. Also collected were a bumkin, deadlight, brass fitting and some ballast stones from the wreck, together with old bottles and pieces of Muntz metal from Pelsaert Island.

1875 and was owned by Thompson & Co. of Leith (Lloyds Shipping Register 1888-
89). The vessel was en route from Cardiff, Wales to Hong Kong with a cargo of coal
on 23 December 1888, when land was sighted just north of Cape Farquhar. There
was a fresh breeze from the south and the vessel kept off the land, which was scarcely
visible at sundown. At 8pm, the vessel struck a reef off Point Cloates. The master,
Captain John Burns, immediately attempted to put the ship around, but the bow
was struck by a breaker, sending the vessel further onto the reef. Attempts to get the
port lifeboat launched were foiled due to the sea making a clear breach over that side.
Fortunately, the starboard boat was successfully launched and as the cabin was now
full of water with the deck fittings washing about, all hands quickly boarded the
boat. They pulled away from the ship, and not knowing what dangers lay between
them and the shore, kept out to sea until daylight, when the y tried to re-board the
ship. With the sea breaking right over it, however, they had to abandon the attempt.
Finding an opening in the reef, they were able to guide the boat through and safely
reached the shore. As there had not been sufficient time to properly provision the
lifeboat, they had no food at all, though they did have a supply of water. Hoping
that some provisions might be washed ashore from the wreck, the men stayed at
the spot where they had landed, and on the 25th, a tank full of flour was found on
the beach. This allowed them to make some damper using salt water and the flour.
Taking a supply of the bread, they set off down the coast towards the south, leaving a
message attached to the lifeboat to inform searchers where they had gone. They were
fortunate in encountering some local Aborigines, who directed them to Brockman’s
station at Yalobia. Arriving there on the night of 27 December, they were met by the
sheep manager, Grierson, and stayed with him until 6 January 1889, when the cutter
Gipsy arrived. The Gipsy’s crew had discovered the message left with the lifeboat and
set out to find the castaways. The twenty-eight men left Yalobia in the cutter on 6
January 1889. With so many aboard the small vessel, provisions ran out well before
the Gipsy reached Carnarvon on 16 January (West Australian 16/01/1889p3a).
At the inquiry, which was held at Carnarvon, evidence echoed that given in the
Perth inquiry the previous year. The master and mates were cleared of all blame, the
cause of the wreck being given as a strong current setting from the northwest, and
wrongly laid down in the Admiralty sailing charts. This verdict was criticised by
Captain Charles Russell, the Chief Harbourmaster who quoted from the Admiralty
sailing directions, which clearly warned of the possibility of a current setting towards
the land in the vicinity of Point Cloates. The Collector of Customs also expressed dissatisfaction with the findings. He complained of the requirement for the inquiries
to be held at Carnarvon, the nearest port, and suggested that in the cases of both
the Benan and the Perth, a Fremantle court of inquiry may have reached a different
conclusion (Cairns & Henderson 1995:127-129).
The course of the Benan and the sequence of its wrecking was charted and at the
time compared to that of S.S. Perth which had wrecked at Point Cloates just over a

"Black Swan","1851/05","Murray Estuary","","","","","N","2.80","","General","us 775, Aus 116 & WA 848","Little is known of the cutter Black Swan which was owned by Anthony Curtis, merchant and ship-owner of Fremantle. However it is believed to have been built in New South Wales with a square stern, and with no galleries or figurehead. The cutter transported cargo between Fremantle and the Busselton region, calling at various anchorages, often taking cattle on the return voyage. The earliest record of this trade appears to be an entry in the magistrate’s memorandum book for Vasse which shows the Black Swan, Captain Leary in command, arriving at that port from Fremantle on 18 October 1843. Despite the comparatively small size of this vessel it carried nine passengers on one voyage from Fremantle to Bunbury in September 1850.
THE LOSS
With a gale in the offing the Black Swan was working out of the Peel Inlet when it went aground on the bar at the entrance, and could not be got off before the gale struck, causing it to become a total wreck.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
In 1978 an anchor was uncovered by a dragline dredge operating in the Mandurah ocean marina area. The anchor, retrieved from a depth of 12 ft (3.7 m), was ‘heavily coated with limestone’ (Coastal District Times, 18 June 1982: 3c-e). The newspaper speculated that the anchor may have come from the Leviathan, wrecked in August 1921 (see entry). However, because the anchor had a substantial limestone concretion it would appear to have probably come from a much earlier wreck, possibly the Black Swan, the Alert or the Preston, although concretion is not necessarily indicative of a long period underwater.","NO","NSW","4","","","1.90","N","206/80","N","N","","","11.00","","","","","","Westernport","Bunbury","","Vasse","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

THE LOSS
The Britannia was being sailed by two men, Muller and Brown, close to the shore as they were unable to beat out to sea. A heavy squall caused them to anchor, but the chain parted and the yacht was thrown onto the shore where its side was stove in. The boat was hauled higher up the beach and left for the night. However the high tide reached the Britannia and it drifted onto some rocks where it was smashed beyond repair.","NO","Unknown","2","","2","","N","405/71","N","N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

John Byrne owned it in 1923. It was one of the luggers that Dennis (Dinny) Ahearn received as payment as part of a business deal, and which he then used for fishing. The Brittania was heading to Shark Bay when wrecked.
THE LOSS
Brittania ran on to a reef about 5 miles north of Lucky Bay, and despite the efforts of the crew they could not get it off. The crew then rowed their dinghy to Port Gregory to seek assistance. They returned with help, but despite the efforts of all concerned, the lugger could not be saved.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Sails, spars and various other items were salvaged but the vessel and the 2.5 tons of fish in the icebox were lost. The Brittania was not insured.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
SOCIAL (3)
It appears that the previous owner of Brittania used it as part payment in the purchase of farming land from Ahearn, who wanted to enter the fishing industry.

THE VESSEL
The Bronlan was built at Fremantle by Alfred Edmund Brown, and registered as number 1 of 1911. The first owner was the Oriental Pearling Company. It was later owned by Thomas Hughes Owen of Broome. In 1937 it was rebuilt, an engine installed and re-registered as number 3 of 1937. On the death of Thomas Hughes Owen in December 1937, ownership passed to Thomas Tudor Hughes Owen of Derby. It seems probable that Thomas Hughes Owen mortgaged the vessel to Herbert Kennedy and later to A.C. Gregory, these mortgages being discharged at the time of his death.","","","","","","","","","N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Not protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

"Brothers","1878/07","Esperance-Fremantle","James Storey","Mary and Edward Higham, of Fremantle","","Went missing","N","5.24","","",""," The two-masted topsail schooner Brothers was built by David James Storey in his yard at South Beach, and launched on Thursday 20 January 1876.
On the 20th inst. Mr. James Storey made another successful launch of a pretty model schooner of 50 tons burden; she is built of Jarrah, the most durable wood known, for ship building purposes, and effectively resists all attacks of marine insects. Her owners are Messrs H. Higham and Son who have had her built expressly for the pearl shell fishery trade and christened her the Brothers (W. A. Times, 25 January 1876: 3a).
It appears that the Brothers saw little if any service in the pearling industry, as almost immediately after the launching it was involved in the salvage of the brigantine Kitty Coburn off Augusta, which took most of 1876.  By mid-1878 it was again heading south from Fremantle, having been chartered by Andrew Dempster to carry him, his wife and six children to Esperance, departing Fremantle on 23 June. Dempster had secured the contract to build the police station at Esperance, and also had on board material to undertake this task. The Brothers arrived in Esperance safely after encountering a storm during which the captain, J. Taquer, became drunk, leaving the navigation to Dempster. The vessel leaked badly and the crew were constantly at the pumps.
THE LOSS
After offloading the Dempster family and 11 other passengers at Esperance, the Brothers sailed out of Esperance on 12 July 1878 bound for Fremantle. It was not seen again, and despite checks being made by mounted constables of schooner sightings at Hamelin Bay in September and Cape Naturaliste in October, the fate of the vessel remains a mystery.","NO","WA","","","All","2.16","N","","N","N","","","19.70","","","","","72481","Fremantle","Esperance","Fremantle","Fremantle","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

THE VESSEL
There has been much confusion regarding the name of this vessel. It has been suggested that ‘Bunyip’ is the idiomatic corruption of the name ‘Cartabunup’. The Cartabunup (also variously spelt Catabunup, Cartaburnup, Caltaburnup, Cuttyburnup, Cuttabunup and Carter Bunyup) was a 60-ton cutter said to have been built by John Odgers Peters on the King River at Albany. It was supposedly named for the hill near the building site. The Minang people who built fish traps in Oyster Harbour called the place ‘Kaatbornup’ meaning ‘wooded hill’, referring to the very large marri trees which once grew nearby. The vessel Cartabunup was owned by John McKenzie of Albany. There is no registration record of either Cartabunup or Bunyip (or any of the derivations) in Western Australia. Despite this the Bunyip was reported by the Inquirer as being an ‘Albany cutter’.
The cutter Cartabunup/Bunyip, about which so little is known, was under the command of Captain John Foote, and had been chartered by Mr Gilham to carry wire and insulators for the construction of the overland telegraph line between Adelaide and Albany.
 In late May 1877 the Cartabunup/Bunyip and another cutter, the Twilight, also chartered by Gilham, were anchored at Twilight Cove discharging cargo which was sufficient to construct 100 miles (160 km) of the line.
THE LOSS
About midnight on 24 May 1877 a severe gale struck, and the anchor cable of the Twilight parted and that cutter was driven ashore and wrecked (see entry). Only 2½ hours later the Cartabunup/Bunyip also parted its cable, drove onto the beach and was abandoned. The crew of both vessels made shore safely. The loss of the cargo was stated to have set the telegraph line construction back some six weeks. Gilham, on his arrival in Adelaide from King George Sound aboard the R.M.S. Bangalore, advised the South Australian Register of his loss. That newspaper subsequently telegraphed the news to the Sydney Morning Herald.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The newspaper reported that the cargo was buried in the sand and considered impossible to recover.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Cartabunup/Bunyip was reported as being 180 m west of the wreck of the Twilight, however the exact position of neither wreck is now known.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
The building of the Overland Telegraph Line provided steady work for a number of mainly Western Australian coastal traders. These included the Agnes, Cartabunup/Bunyip, Mary Ann, Planet, Tribune, Twilight and Walter & Mary.

"Cambewarra","3686","Near Fisherman's Island, 50 miles south of Dongara","Werf Gusto, firma A. F. Smulders","NSW Goverment","Captain B. H. van der Hey Jr","Holed on reef","Y","","","Delivery voyage","AUS 753, 333, 1033","Built by Werf Gusto, Firma A.F. Smulders of Schiedam (Holland) for the New South Wales Government, the Cambewarra was designed to carry 400 tonnes of blue metal from the government quarries at Kiama and Port Kembla. It was specially designed for the rapid discharge of this cargo. It had two engines. The vessel was valued at £20?000. The Cambewarra was on its maiden voyage from the builders to Sydney under the command of Captain Van der Key (Van der Hey in the Proceedings of the Court of Navigation, WAM File MA-3/90) with a crew of fourteen. The captain had planned to sail through Torres Strait to his destination but en route he calculated that the strong currents in the strait would mean burning more coal than he had left on board. With no bunkering port near Cape York, he decided to sail via Fremantle instead, and take on coal there. He did not, however, have any detailed charts for this route.
THE LOSS
After bunkering at Colombo in Sri Lanka the Cambewarra sighted the Western Australian coast on 1 February 1914. Because of high winds, the captain kept close to shore to minimize the amount of water the ship was taking from the heavy seas. It passed through the Geelvink Channel and sighted Point Moore Lighthouse at a distance of three miles. At 1.05 a.m. on the morning of Tuesday, 3 February, doing 7.5 knots; it struck a reef a number of times but finished in clear water. The vessel was then steered away from the coast on a westerly course. It was found however that the port propeller was broken and the ship was taking in water entering through two large holes under the engine room. Attempts to stop the inflow of water using tarpaulins failed. The rising water extinguished the boiler fires, so steam was blown off to lessen the chance of the boilers exploding. Without boiler pressure the Cambewarra had neither engine power nor steam for the steam pumps. The vessel then drifted, with the men hard at work on the hand pumps. By daylight the ship was some 4–5 miles from where it had struck.
The ship’s boat was dispatched under the command of the chief mate, B.J. Staal, second engineer and three crewmen to row east to the coast (estimated to be 14 miles away) to get assistance. They reached shore, and Staal and two others headed north to seek help while the others remained where they had come ashore. After a 32 km walk that took a day and a half, the three men reached Dongara. The light keeper at Dongara advised the Geraldton harbour-master, who then sent a boat to collect the two crewmen still on the beach.
Shortly after the departure of the ship’s boat, two fishing boats arrived at the Cambewarra. These were Lapwing, owned by Angelo Fortunata, and La Mascott. The seas were too high for Lapwing to come alongside, so its dinghy was used to transfer some luggage and personal effects from the Cambewarra. While this work was being carried out the second mate, W. Roeske, and two crewmen launched a small boat. They had barely got into this dinghy when the Cambewarra’s stern went under and it heeled over to starboard and sank, upturning the boat and dragging all three men under the water. They managed to regain the surface and were picked up by one of the fishing boats. The sinking Cambewarra also sucked Captain Van der Key and the first engineer under, but they too were able to swim and were picked up by La Mascott.
Both fishing boats took the survivors to Fremantle, La Mascott had three and Lapwing had six aboard. The fact that the first mate and his crew had reached Dongara, and the two on the beach had also been rescued, was not known in Fremantle and so the Chief Harbour-Master dispatched the steamer Penguin to search for the crew of the Cambewarra’s boat.
There is a disagreement of facts between Totty and Loney. Totty indicates that all crew survived, while Loney states that that there was a loss of six lives. Various sources in WAM File MA-3/90, including the Court of Navigation proceedings and contemporary newspapers, indicate that all crew were rescued.
INQUIRY
As the vessel was under the Dutch flag until handed over to the New South Wales Government, the Dutch Consul in Fremantle, R. Strelitz, proposed to hold a preliminary inquiry into the sinking. A Court of Navigation in the Netherlands on 15 May 1914 found that ‘reason of the wrecking of the Cambewarra must be ascribed to its striking a rock which was on its course but not indicated on the map’ (Proceedings of the Court of Navigation, quoted in WAM File MA-3/90).
INITIAL SALVAGE
Apart from personal effects saved by the fishing boat Lapwing no salvage was carried out. The vessel was covered by insurance on behalf of the builders, as the contract for construction was for safe delivery under steam at Sydney.
SITE LOCATION
The Cambewarra lies in deep water 11.8 miles from Island Point, 8.37 miles from Seal Island, 10.8 miles from Green Head and 8.75 miles from North Head (all radar distances).
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck lies on a N–S axis on a sand bottom in 57 m of water. It appears to be virtually upright, with the lower part of the hull buried to a depth of 2–2.5 m. The bow and stern sections are relatively intact but the midships has collapsed inwards. The wreck is 45–47 m long and 10–12 m wide amidships.

"Camel","1926","Off Emu Point, Albany in Oyster Harbour","W. & G. White of Williamstown","Armstrong & Waters, Albany or James Ball, lighterman","","After colliding with an Avon Dredge","Y","6.65","","","","Official Number:	101716
The Camel was built by G. White at Williamstown, Victoria, as a sailing lighter with one mast, a round stern and five bulkheads, and was used at Melbourne. It was so named because of its role as a carrier of fresh water supplies to ships anchored offshore. The Camel had its holds lined with Muntz metal to ensure water-tightness, protect the timber structure and also maintain the purity of the water. It was fitted with four brass or bronze chainplates on each side, about 1.5 m long and 3.8 cm thick. It appears not to have been registered until purchased by McIlwraith, McEacharn Ltd in 1897, when it was registered at Melbourne (No. 8/1897).  In that year it was towed to Albany by the steamer Tagliaferro to undertake the same role, arriving on 21 June 1897. It was the last water barge brought to the port.
In early 1907 it was stripped of its spars and rigging and converted to a barge to be towed, and as a consequence it underwent a survey and was re-registered, this time at Fremantle (No. 4/1907). A contemporary photograph shows it to have had any existing superstructure removed and a tin shed erected on the stern. The Camel was sold to James Ball of Fremantle in December 1915, and subsequently to Armstrong and Waters of Albany.
THE LOSS
During the very severe south-east gale that struck Albany in 1921 the Camel was driven ashore and seriously damaged. Some twelve months later it again suffered damage in a gale when it broke adrift from its moorings and collided with the Avon Dredge. Both vessels drifted to near the tug landing stage. The barge was not repaired after this incident, but it remained afloat despite having a large hole above the waterline.
The Camel was subsequently purchased by Alf Swarbrick. He was going to dismantle it and use the timber for decking on a slipway he was building at Emu Point. However, he found that the timber had deteriorated so much that it was useless for this purpose. The barge was towed a little way into Oyster Harbour to the east of the entrance and abandoned. Some time later, most probably in 1926, a party was held aboard the Camel. During the night it was accidentally set on fire and burned to the waterline.
INITIAL SALVAGE
It is most likely that the brass or bronze chainplates on the Camel were salvaged, but there was possibly little else of value to save.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Camel lies in a depression on the sea floor 75 m from the shore in water only 1-1½ m deep inside Oyster Harbour, south-south-east of Green Island.
SITE DESCRIPTION
In 1991 Dr Michael McCarthy led a team from the Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum, on a wreck inspection. The remains of the Camel were found to consist of the vessel’s bottom, including keel, keelson, floors and the stem and stern posts. It is lying on an east-west axis, with the remains of the sides showing as charred timber. The wreck is 24.1 m long and about 3m wide. The keel has a width of 37 cm, and the frames average 20 cm in width with a spacing of 7 cm. Some iron knees are visible, with one found on shore probably indicating the position of the salvors’ camp. The Muntz metal lining is evident, as well as a large bollard near the bow. The remains are surrounded by thick ribbon weed which helps protect the wreck from natural forces.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
During the wreck inspection some fastenings and sheathing were removed from the wreck for analysis by the Western Australian Museum.

"Carbet Castle","1897/05/14","Bunbury, Koombanah Bay","","J. Moralee junior","Captain William Turnbull Stevens","Parted moorings","Y","11.60","","Railway Iron/ Goods","PWD 50976"," Carbet Castle was built under Special Survey by Mounsey & Foster, being launched at Sunderland in July 1875. It had two decks, one bulkhead, a poop 15.9 m long and a forecastle with a length of 9.1 m. In 1897 the owner was J. Moralee (Jr). The barque had departed Newport, Wales, on 14 January 1897 under the command of Captain W.T. Stevens, arriving at Bunbury on 2 April 1897, and was moored to a ring on the government mooring by 15 fathoms (27.5 m) of cable and a swivel shackle. This mooring had only been recently laid in five fathoms (9.1 m), and was considered capable of holding any vessel likely to load at Bunbury. It consisted of two 4-ton anchors joined by a chain having links weighing 96 lb (43.6 kg) each.
The Carbet Castle was carrying a mixed cargo, with the major item being railway material for the Collie to Bridgetown railway. The cargo had been insured with the Commercial Union Assurance Company for about £12?000 (Inquirer, 21 May 1897: 7g), and approximately half had been discharged by 14 May when the wreck occurred.
THE LOSS
On 14 May 1897 a gale had been blowing from the west since the previous evening. In the early morning it veered to the north-west accompanied by fierce squalls, and by 8.00 a.m. the barometer had fallen to 29.60 in (1?002.4 hPa). Captain Stevens had the port anchor let go and paid out 15 fathoms (27.5 m) of cable, which he almost immediately increased to 30 fathoms (55 m). He then ‘hauled the fore-yards round to the wind, as the Corolla was dragging towards us, to keep clear’ (The Bunbury Herald, 21 May 1897: 3a-b). At 10.15 a.m., after a terrific rain squall, the wind abruptly changed back to the west. The Carbet Castle swung in that direction, and was considered by those on shore to have weathered the gale. Suddenly, however, the vessel swung broadside to the sea as it appeared to part from the mooring. ‘The shift of wind gave the vessel a clear run of nearly two miles to the beach, and before this was reached the captain made two attempts to bring her up, but the vessel swung, tightened out the cables, and snapped them’ (Inquirer, 21 May 1897: 7g). The captain’s statement to the Court of Inquiry differs from this in that, even though he paid out more cable on his anchor, he claims the Carbet Castle dragged both the mooring buoy and his port anchor with it, and it became apparent that it was the government mooring that had parted from its ground tackle. He had no time to set sail (the sails were on the yards), and also the ship’s head was canted the wrong way to set them.
The Carbet Castle struck bottom, stern first, ‘1½ miles [2.4 km] north of Bunbury’ (West Australian, 15 May 1897: 4h), or ‘2½ miles [4 km] north of the river bar’ (Inquirer, 21 May 1897: 7g). The barque ended up close to the shore; 3 chains (60 m) in one report, and 100 yards (30 m) in the captain’s statement to the court. It lay broadside on with tremendous seas breaking over the starboard quarter only 15 minutes after the parting of the government mooring. The barque rapidly began to take in water. The captain and two of the apprentices swam ashore, taking lines along which the other crewmen were rescued. The newspaper reported that four boat loads of rescuers went to the aid of the crew of the Carbet Castle. ‘Three of those boats were engaged by Sergeant Osborne. The other, the agent’s boat, contained Mr. Thos. Hayward and Constable Vaughn with three assistants’ (The Bunbury Herald, 14 May 1897: 3b). The rescuers manned the shoreward end of the rope from the vessel. The last man off was the steward, who was exhausted and in danger of getting washed out to sea when a human chain formed by those on shore managed to get hold of him. At 2.00 p.m. the mainmast fell, breaking off close to the deck and taking part of the mizenmast with it. The Carbet Castle quickly became a total wreck.
INQUIRY
After an inspection of the wreck of the Carbet Castle by George H. Johnston, underwriter for the Commercial Union Insurance Company, and Captain Webster, Lloyd’s surveyor, a Preliminary Court of Inquiry was held at Bunbury before William Henry Timperley, subcollector of Customs, and James Moore, J.P., with the result that:
We find that the ship Carbet Castle was driven on shore in the port of Bunbury on the morning of the 14th day of May 1897 during an exceptionally heavy squall of wind when she parted from the Government moorings and dragged her anchor and we agree there is no cause for investigation (Bunbury Herald, 21 May 1897: 3a-b).
Although the enquiry exonerated the captain and crew it did not explain why the newly laid government mooring had failed, and the Perth press later reported:
The action of the Harbour Department in not holding an enquiry into the cause of the mooring parting, with the result that the Carbet Castle was driven ashore at Bunbury recently, is much commented on in the local Press (West Australian, 2 June 1897: 5d).
INITIAL SALVAGE
On 18 May 1897 tenders were called for the salvage of that part of the cargo of the Carbet Castle still on board (some 750 tons of rails and fastenings); the cargo to be delivered and stacked on the beach close to the wreck. On the morning of 29 May an auction of sails, furniture, ship’s stores, etc. was conducted by James Moore. That afternoon an auction of the railway material was held by Messrs Courthope, Drummond & Co. The purchasers were Messrs Millar Bros, the amount paid being £1 500 (The Bunbury Herald, 1 June 1897: 3c). Mr Wheeler had the contract to bring ashore the various effects from the stranded barque. Part of the cargo, specifically some of the spirits and clothing, was reported to have been stolen from the wreck.
On 26 June 1897 the newspaper reported:
The work of taking out the railway rails from the wrecked barque Carbet Castle is now going on satisfactorily. 1 400 rails have been taken from the fore hold which is now cleared. A commencement was made yesterday getting the rails from the after hold which it is found is much easier work, that part of the wreck being more free from sand or kelp. Capt. Stevens is confident he will have all the rails out of the wreck in five weeks (Bunbury Herald, 26 June 1897: 3c).
A bench seat and light from the Carbet Castle are at King Cottage Museum in Bunbury, and the bell hangs at the Cathedral Grammar School. The ship’s clock was donated to the Western Australian Museum in the estate of Lillian Jane Shaw. Her father, John Shaw, had been presented with the clock by Captain Stevens soon after the wreck. A number of items of furniture from the vessel are held in private hands in the Bunbury area, including, at one time, a staircase and piano at the Parade Hotel. Some of the soft-wood deck of the Carbet Castle was used by Engelbert ‘Joe’ Springman to construct the floor of the kitchen in his house at Turkey Point. A copper loud hailer from the vessel was donated to the Western Australian Museum by Rod Dickson.
SITE LOCATION
Both Theo Hall and Roy Dedman remember that as boys they could swim around the wreck of the Carbet Castle. As sand gradually built up they could wade out to the wreck, later walk to it, then around it. This gives a vivid picture of how the shoreline extended seawards with the result that the wreck became shore-bound through natural silting, so that it now lies about 500 m from the water’s edge under five metres of sand.

"Cervantes","1844/06/20","Jurien Bay","","Benjamin Brown, Jonathon Coit, Amos Willetts, e.a.","Sylvanus Gibson","","Y","7.50","","Whaling Oil","PWD 47233","  Cervantes was originally built as a whaling brig with one deck, square stern and a billet head. It was copper fastened and had a coppered bottom. It was built in 1836 in Bathe, Maine, and registered in that port on 4 October 1836. The vessel’s owners were Richard McManus of Brunswick and Frederic G. Thurston of New York. The vessel was subsequently owned by a consortium consisting of Benjamin Brown, Jonathon Coit, Amos Willets, Samuel Willets, Nathan Belden and her master, Captain Sylvanus Gibson. They had it converted to barque rig in June 1841, and the registration was changed from Bath to New London. The first whaling voyage to Western Australia had taken place in late 1841. This had been under the command of B.F. Brown, possibly the Benjamin Brown mentioned above as being one of the owners.
In 1841 while in Albany re-victualling three crew, Joseph Clark, John Morrison and James Wolley, deserted. After being captured and gaoled they broke out of gaol and hid, giving themselves up to the authorities only after the Cervantes had left port. They were each fined 10 shillings, in default of 10 days hard labour.
When it was wrecked the Cervantes was on its second whaling voyage to Western Australia, having left New London on 23 June 1843. The barque must have spent some time on the Western Australian coast, as it was in the Geographe Bay area during January and February of 1844. Despite this it had managed to obtain only ten barrels of oil at the time it was wrecked.
THE LOSS
The Cervantes was anchored in Jurien Bay and the crew were fishing when a gale blew up. Before the vessel could make sail and weather the gale out at sea it was driven on to a sand-bar. The crew got ashore, and three of them arrived in Perth on 6 July to report the loss. On 9 July the master, Sylvanus Gibson, and more crew arrived. He reported that one man had been left some 30 miles (50 km) north of the Moore River, while another six crewmen had returned to the wreck site. They intended to get a boat from the Cervantes in order to sail to Fremantle. Henderson (1980: 208) says that Captain Gibson said that the vessel had suffered only minor damage. However its keel was broken, and because of the distance from Fremantle, which was the nearest place where effective repairs could be carried out, it was decided to sell the vessel.
INITIAL SALVAGE
L. & W. Samson conducted the auction of the Cervantes and its contents. The wreck with all its stores and whaling gear fetched £155. The ship’s chronometer sold separately for £23 (Henderson)/£28 (WAM File MA-409/71). The salvors sent by the purchaser, Mr Wicksteed (or Wickstead), reported the wreck as still standing when they salvaged gear in August. In fact Joshua William Gregory said it was still visible above water when he surveyed that section of the coast in the schooner Thetis in 1847. Mr Wicksteed contemplated setting up a whaling station using the salvaged gear as the crew of the Cervantes had reported many seals in the area.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck lies in 2–3 m of water about 0.5 n mile WSW of Thirsty Point.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
During the first exploratory wreck inspection various materials were collected and analysed to aid in determining the name of the wrecked vessel. A local person recovered some timber in July 2002. Pieces of old timber, probably from this wreck, are sometimes found on the beach near Cervantes.","NO","USA","9","2004/01","","3.50","N","2009/0087/SG _MA-409/71","Y","Y","-30.5133666667","","0.00","25.00","115.05","","2.00","","Bath, Maine","Fishing ground","New London","New London (end of whaling trip)","GPS, 2012","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

"Chance","1843/05","Albany, Michaelmas Isalnd","Solomon Cook","","","","N","4.45","","","AUS 110, AUS 118, AUS 759 & BA 2619","The Chance was built on the Kalgan River at Albany by Solomon Cook, who completed the schooner on 5 July 1842. Cook had deserted from the American whaler Mayflower (350 tons, Captain Henry Colt) on Thursday 27 February 1840. The owner of the Chance was Thomas Brooker Sherratt, who used it, with a crew of four, as a tender for his bay whaling and sealing venture. The Chance had been to Lombok to purchase supplies (mainly rice) for use by the whaling parties. When it arrived at Fremantle on the voyage north, the local press stated that the Chance ‘is pronounced to be an excellent sea boat’ (Perth Gazette, 10 December 1842: 2a).
Returning from Lombok the Chance was anchored in Koombana Bay when, on 10 April 1843, a north-easterly gale caused the anchor to drag. The master, Captain Johnson Hume, steered for the mouth of the Leschenault Inlet and the schooner passed over the bar, striking twice. It then ran aground inside the inlet. After unloading the cargo of rice and selling the damaged portion, the schooner was refloated on 19 April and anchored once more in Koombana Bay where the undamaged rice was reloaded and it sailed for Albany soon after.
THE LOSS
There are five contemporary references to the loss of the Chance at Albany. The Reverend Wollaston mentions in his journal that less than two months after departing Koombana Bay it was wrecked and went to pieces. A Perth newspaper reported ‘the Cheerful touched at King George’s Sound, and brings us the report of the loss of the cutter Chance off Michaelmas Island’ (Perth Gazette, 20 May 1843: 2a). Two months later a Sydney newspaper stated: ‘The schooner Chance, of King George’s Sound, had also been totally lost’ (Sydney Morning Herald, 13 July 1843: 2a). This same information was also reported in The Australian the following day. A letter from the Government Resident at Albany to the Colonial Secretary dated 15 October 1843 regarding the disappearance of Captain Hume also mentions the loss of the Chance (CSR 119/159).
The builder of the Chance was Solomon Cook, who, in 1840, had deserted from the American whaling ship Mayflower. The Mayflower’s log entry regarding that incident reads:
Thurs, Feb 27th; Commences with strong winds and pleasant weather. Employed with two boats awooding. At night the liberty men came on board. At 11pm Solomon Cook, Benjamin Owens, William Lynch and Neil Chamberlain and John Mitchell loard the bow boat down and landed on shore careing thare cloths and a weeks provisions. Latter part, at daylight found the boat gone. I went on shore in persute of them, found the boat and took her to the ship. At 6½am Captain Colt went on shore and sent the constables in persute (spelling as per log book, quoted in Dickson, 2007: 132).
Cook escaped capture, later becoming a naturalized citizen. After being involved in building another boat for Sherratt (the 92-ton brigantine Emma Sherratt built at Torbay by Mr Jenkins) he moved to Perth, where he was involved in many other projects. These included the original Canning Bridge and the first steam boat on the Swan River.
It would appear that the master of the Chance when it was wrecked, Captain Hume, not only lost his ship but also his employment with Sherratt, and a short time later his life. A letter from the Government Resident at Albany, John Randall Phillips, to the Colonial Secretary dated 15 October 1843 states:
I have received news that Mr Hume late Master of the Chance which cutter was wrecked last year here, was missing from his place of residence at Wilson’s Inlet where he had become Hut Keeper for John W. Andrews. I sent out a party in search of him, but have not been enabled to gain any trace so far of him. Some Natives have reported having seen him with his face very bloody, and that he had been ill used by a man of the name of Cole – who is shepherd to J.W. Andrews flock of sheep and has been an Old Van D.L. Convict. Hume’s shoes and hat were found in the Hut, by the extra constable sent on this search as both the other Constables were away executing Warrants at Two People Bay. And as Hume has been missing for more than three weeks I am sadly afraid no trace will be found of him (CSR 119/159).","NO","WA","4","","","2.10","N","195/72","N","N","","","11.98","","","","","","Kalgan River, King George Sound","Fremantle","Albany","Albany","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

Apart from the tonnage, the specifications of this vessel are not known. It was sailing from Liverpool to Melbourne with a general cargo that included ‘a steam sawmill, contrived somewhat like a locomotive, so that it can be wheeled about by a couple of horses…an iron-store, parts of iron houses, 10 000 bricks, &c.’ (Gazette, 16 December 1853: 2d). In command was Captain Arthur Burns, with a crew of ten and fifteen passengers, including three women and one child. The owner and his family were on board.
THE LOSS
The master of the Charles Fox Bennett decided that because of ‘a severe scorbutic [scurvy] attack’ aboard his vessel he would call at Augusta, which he had noted on his chart, for fresh food. Doing two knots before a light breeze the vessel struck a rock 2½ miles (4.6 km) from Cape Leeuwin and a mile (1.85 km) from the shore. Two hours later the rudder broke adrift. The crew were set to lightening the vessel, but:
As night approached squalls rain thunder and lightning prevailed. The sea getting up the vessel struck heavily on the rocks and the crew would not remain on board during the night she came on shore (Molloy to Colonial Secretary, 3 December 1853).
The deserted Charles Fox Bennett came free of the reef during the night and drifted ashore, where it ‘was wrecked on a flattish ledge of rocks 2 miles to the eastward of Cape Leeuwin’ (Inquirer, 30 November 1853: 3d). However the weather worsened and the following night the waves washed the vessel off, and it sank very close to the shore:
…lying on a ledge of rocks within 15 or 20 yards from the shore, the water being up to her decks, showing considerable injury to her bottom, otherwise the hull is uninjured. A great portion of her cargo has been landed…(Gazette, 16 December 1853: 2d).
The mate travelled to the Vasse aboard the American whaler Henry and Mary to report the wrecking. The Resident Magistrate at Vasse, John Molloy, immediately dispatched a police officer named Guerrin (probably Roger Guerin) to prevent any ‘mutiny and insubordination.’ The master and the owner of the Charles Fox Bennet also travelled to the Vasse to make their report on the disaster, returning to Augusta on 3 December 1853.
The captain of the William Pope, which had been in Castle Bay on its way south, travelled to the Vasse to inform Molloy that he would call in on his passage to collect the passengers with a view to taking them to Melbourne should an opportunity arise.
INQUIRY
A very brief report of the accident was sent by John Molloy, R.M., on 25 November 1853 to the Colonial Secretary in Perth (see illustration):
 Port Vasse
 25th Nov 1853
Sir
I have the honour to acquaint
you that by information received
this afternoon from the first mate
 Arthur Burns master
of the vessel Charles Fox Bennett
burthen 127 tons from Liverpool
general cargo bound to Melbourne
crew ten men—has altogether 15
passengers including 3 women &
1 child—that on the 18th instant in
the bay of Augusta a light wind

eastward of Cape Lewin [sic] she went
on shore on a flatish ledge of
rocks & there remains. The mate…
[last two lines undecipherable].
 I have the honour to be
 Sir
 Your obedient [?]
 J. Molloy
(State Records Office CSR Vol 279/206)
This was deemed to be lacking in detail and Molloy was requested to submit a fuller report. He did so on 3 December 1853. There does not appear to have been a formal inquiry carried out.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Salvage of the cargo of the Charles Fox Bennett was commenced almost immediately using a landing stage built from the beach to the wreck, and in a little over a week the crew had landed about 100 tons of cargo, including the mobile steam sawmill. This was purchased by Henry Yelverton for £210. Other sales brought the total figure raised to £2 500.
We understand that in most instances the articles realised full English prices, notwithstanding the risk of their having received more or less damage (Gazette, 27 January 1854: 2b).
Although in shallow water, only 2.4–2.7 m deep, the vessel could not be salvaged and some of the bricks and heavy iron remained in the hull.
SITE LOCATION
It has been suggested that a wreck found in Ringbolt Bay in 1980 may be that of the Charles Fox Bennett, although this has now been shown to most probably be the wreck of the cutter Eva. The Resident Magistrate’s report and newspapers would seem to indicate that the Charles Fox Bennett was wrecked a little further east than Ringbolt Bay, possibly near Matthew Point, and much closer to the shore than the Ringbolt Bay wreck. Also, the rudder of the Ringbolt Bay wreck lies at the site, whereas that of the Charles Fox Bennett is reported as having broken adrift prior to the vessel reaching its final position.","NO","Canada","10","","","","N","381/77","N","N","","","","","","","","","St Johns, Newfoundland","Liverpool","","Melbourne","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., (2012).

"Chaudiere","1883/07/04","At anchor, Hamelin Bay","","M.C. Davies of the Jarrahdale Timber Company","Captain William Hayes","Gale, dragged anchor","Y","8.90","","Timber","AUS 116","The Chaudiere was built by W. Doxford at Sunderland for H. & W. Douglas of London, and launched in December 1863. It had a raised quarter deck 12.5 m long, was copper fastened and sheathed with felt and yellow metal. In both 1869 and 1870 the iron beams were damaged and repaired. In 1879 the vessel was owned by Shaw, Savill and Company. In early 1883 it was sold by William Duthie to Maurice Coleman Davies, the owner of considerable timber rights in the south-west of Western Australia. The place of purchase is given as either Adelaide (Inquirer, 11 July 1883: 2f) or Melbourne (Inquirer, 11 April 1883: 2e). Davies intended to use the barque exclusively in the timber trade from Western Australia to Adelaide and Melbourne. The Chaudiere was under the command of William Hayes, and had arrived in Hamelin Bay on 23 May 1883. There were strong winds for the first six weeks, and it was only on 1 July that loading of sleepers could commence.
THE LOSS
During the subsequent inquiries Captain Hayes stated that the Chaudiere was anchored in 7 fathoms (12.8 m) about half to three-quarters of a mile from the shore and about 2 cables (366 m) from Peak Island and Mushroom Rock. The anchor bearings he took showed that the vessel was on a line through Peak and Hamelin islands, and Mushroom Rock lay nearly south. Both anchors weighed 22 cwt (1.12 tonnes) and were equipped with chain cables (3.2 cm diameter on the port and 4.5 cm diameter on the starboard). When it began blowing hard from the north-west he payed out an additional 105 fathoms (192 m) of cable on the port anchor and 90 fathoms (165 m) on the starboard anchor. Hayes went ashore on 3 July to arrange the repair of some pumping gear, but was unable to get back aboard that day because of the deteriorating weather. During the night the wind changed to west-north-west, and on receiving news the following morning that the Chaudiere was dragging, Hayes somehow managed to get aboard. The vessel continued to drag and then struck, so the captain ordered more cable to be payed out and sails loosed in order to ‘harden on the beach’. However the Chaudiere went broadside on. The crew were taken ashore immediately as the barometer was continuing to fall and night was approaching. Captain Hayes later stated that he thought that there was ‘something broken or injured’ about the starboard anchor.
INQUIRY
At the Preliminary Court of Inquiry held at Hamelin before the subcollector of Customs, L. Harris, and Dr Charles Smith Bompas, J.P., into the loss of the Chaudiere, the first mate, John Le Brun, was charged with not using an extra anchor. The subsequent Court of Inquiry lacked suitable experience and the charge was not sustained, although the court did censure Le Brun for ‘having kept his log in such a manner as to be of no use whatsoever’. This was despite evidence by Captain Hayes that Le Brun was a competent mate, whose only failing was that, coming from the island of Jersey, he had a language problem which made his log keeping poor. The Attorney-General later stated that the alleged incompetence regarding log keeping had no bearing on the loss of the Chaudiere.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Captain Hayes’ chronometer is in the possession of Mrs Peggy Davies, whose husband was the grandson of Maurice Coleman Davies.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Chaudiere lies some 650 m north of the base of the Hamelin Jetty, and about 300 m off the beach.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck of the Chaudiere lies on a sandy bottom in 5–6 m water, bow towards the shore on an axis of 97°. The wreckage extends over an area of approximately 35.5 m by 8.5 m. There are the remains of both the planking (95 mm thick) and inner ceiling (70 mm thick), together with paired frames. These frames are 225 mm by 270 mm, with 90–120 mm between each pair. The timber is reported as being soft and damaged by marine borers. Some iron fastenings protrude from the sand in the midships area, and a jumble of iron deck beams stretch from there aft. Little remains of the yellow metal sheathing, although the tarred felt placed between the planking and the sheathing is still visible. The windlass (3.9 m long), an iron mast partner with a diamond shaped hole, an iron strapped deadeye and the conspicuous cargo of sleepers are also visible.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
The museum wreck inspection conducted by Scott Sledge on 27 April 1977 recovered three samples of timber of the planking and frames, a yellow metal fastening bolt, a piece of lead sheet and a stoneware pot sherd.","NO","UK","","2011/02","","5.70","N","2009/0089/SG _MA-355/77","Y","Y","-34.2164183333","","41.20","","115.0318283333","","","48683","Sunderland","","Adelaide","","GPS from DoLA Aerial 2004/3/31","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

north of the North West Whaling Station’, the 7939 ton SS Shunsei Maru owned
by the Tomamohosaji Kisen Kaisha (Shipping Company) of Kobe sent out distress
signals. These radio signals were answered by the 4498 ton SS Chofuku Maru owned
by Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha ( KK Line) also of Kobe. Both ships were carrying a
cargo of bagged wheat to Japan.
On reaching the coast the Chofuku Maru initially mistook SS Fin which was
aground at Fraser Island for the Shunsei Maru and headed in towards it before
anchoring offshore. A heavy southerly wind caused the anchors to drag and the ship
struck a reef with its stern, damaging a propeller blade. On realising that the Shunsei
Maru lay further north the ship moved up the coast despite the vibration caused by
the damaged propellor. Though safely anchored outside the reef in deep water, the
anchor chain caught on a ledge or reef and the cable parted. Another anchor was let
go, but it was lost and the ship drifted onto the reef in strong south-westerly winds.
An attempt was made to lower a lifeboat and it too was lost. For a while the two
ships remained on the reef less than a mile apart, both salvable until a fire broke out
on the Chofuku Maru causing its complete abandonment. The Shunsei Maru was
got off and the Perth-based West Australian newspaper carried the story thus:
The two Japanese freighters Shunsei Maru and Chofuku Maru ran on the reefs
within a short distance of each other, near Point Cloates. The first was the Shunsei
Maru. In answer to her wireless calls the Chofuku Maru rendered assistance but
got out of hand in a heavy swell which forced her onto the reef. A fire which
broke out on the Chofuku Maru destroyed much of the superstructure. Captain
R.J. Sinclair, in charge of salvage of the Shunsei Maru after surveying position of
Shunsei Maru and outcrops of rocks and reefs nearby, moved his party on to the
still smouldering Chofuku Maru to salvage what gear that they may need to assist
in salvaging to Shunsei Maru. Much of the gear taken off had to be doust into the
sea for a few minutes to cool it off so it could be handled, due to fire. Port side of
Chofuku Maru awash, starboard side still afire or smouldering. After 5 days work,
2 anchors each of 3 1/2 tons, a smaller anchor and several fathoms of chain and steel
rope was removed, with the assistance of a Punt from the local whaling station
and a ship’s lifeboat now fitted with a mo0tor engine by a Mr M.M. McBolt,
an engineer from the Whaling Station. Eventually gear was taken to the Shunsei Maru or to positions near reef about the ship for salvage. Mr Frank Ball was the
diver employed to work about the hull and blasting off rock outcrops.
After successfully salvaging Shunsei Maru anchored nearby, because of exhaustion
of salvage crew (3 days without a sleep), and ship under own power made
Carnarvon Harbour and whilst alongside jetty, suffered broken lines and being
blown off jetty in a gale and had to anchor clear of jetty. Weather abated a ship
temporarily repairs to bottom, then sailed for Sonrabaya. (West Australian 1931
ND)
A full account of the events that transpired (with some important observations about
the Indigenous people then inhabiting the region) were recorded some forty years
later when Maurice McBolt gave a presentation to the Augusta Historical Society
(MacBolt 1976). In a transcript of his lecture entitled ‘The Story of Two Ships’ McBolt
recalled that an Aboriginal man the Europeans called ‘Long Tommy’ and his wife
‘Mary Ann’ first reported the stranding of the Shunsei Maru to the whaling station.
McBolt the Chief Engineer at the whaling stations and two workers then went out
to the stranded ship in a small launch. On boarding the ship they found that the crew
of around fifty men were, in MacBolt’s words, ‘not happy about coming ashore as
they could see about twenty Aborigines—they had spears as they had been fishing
and getting turtles’. When MacBolt went ashore and related this to the Aborigines,
they treated the fears of the Japanese who they called the ‘Jerridy-Jerridies’ [ Rice
eaters. ‘Jerridy’ apparently meaning rice in the local dialect] as a ‘huge joke’. McBolt
subsequently returned to the ship and after allaying their fears piloted the crew in their
lifeboats to the beach. The Captain apparently remained on board and according to
MacBolt was later found in his cabin contemplating suicide. After MacBolt threw his
pistol overboard, the Captain went ashore and joined the crew where they remained
for a short time before returning to the ship (MacBolt 1976).
When Chofuku Maru also got into difficulties, it was ‘Long Tommy’ and his
wife ‘Mary Ann’ who again reported the event to the whaling station. In another
important observation MacBolt records that their group was led by a man known
as ‘Dingo Charlie’ and that all twenty in the group were ‘full-blood’ and all could
speak English. Again McBolt went to the rescue, finding a ‘much happier captain and
crew’ than those who were on board the Shunsei Maru. All were subsequently taken
ashore where they were cared for at the whaling station, though their supplies were
bolstered by food taken from the ship augmented with clam meat which the Japanese
found in the shallows. During their absence a fire broke out in the coal bunkers of
the Chofuku Maru. It had also taken on a list to port destroying the superstructure
and leaving the exposed starboard side either in flames or smouldering in the heat.
MacBolt reboarded the ship soon after and went down into the engine room to try
and recover a small lathe only to be forced out by rising waters in the engine room.
Apparently water also got into the wheat causing it to swell and ferment. According
to MacBolt, ‘…extreme pressure had been building up, completely distorting the
decking of the ship above and around the holds. Some time after she had keeled
over and sunk, gases were rising and an unpleasant smell was around’. The crew of
the Chofuku Maru remained at the Station for around two weeks and after customs
and immigration officials had completed their work they were all transported to
Carnarvon, and went from their by ship down to Fremantle and then back home to
Japan.
The salvage of Shunsei Maru : ‘One of the outstanding feats of salvage on the
Australian coast’ (West Australian 26/5/1931)
In the interim the Shunsei Maru crew assisted the Dutch Tug Kraus which had
been sent down from Batavia (Jakarta) in an attempt to free their ship. When this
failed, with the exception of ‘two or three’ who had been left onboard ‘to prevent
the Shunsei Maru being claimed as salvage’ and to act as watchmen, they were all
taken off and went down to Fremantle in the tug. From there, they boarded another
Japanese ship for the voyage home (West Australian 10/3/1931). In the interim a
marine surveyor Captain R. Sinclair had been sent up from the Fremantle Office
of Lloyds of London, the ship’s Underwriters. After electing to proceed on a ‘no
cure no pay basis’ rather than to take a retainer and bonuses, Macbolt surveyed the
inside of the ship, finding it did not look at all promising. The frame was twisted in
places, rivets had sprung along the bilge, and ‘in the engine room the water was waist
high, reaching to the level of the bottom fires and all the holds were nearly full of
water’. The engine’s bearings, the dynamo and other machinery had to be examined
underwater and over a number of weeks were repaired and made ready by MacBolt’s
team. A diver Frank Ball, who had been sent up with his equipment from Fremantle,
commenced a survey of the hull at this same time. He found that the ship was not
holed and began inserting bolts to replace the sprung rivets. He also applied cement
(presumably ‘hydraulic cement which sets underwater) to repair the damaged seams.
In order to haul the ship off using its own steam powered winches, chains and
blocks were sourced from the whaling station and a number of anchors and further
lengths of chain were recovered from the Chofuku Maru. Anchors and chain that
had been recovered from the wreck of the SS Lygnern which stranded at Fremantle
in 1928 and a number of pumps were brought up by the State Shipping Service. A
total of seven anchors and a large amount of chain were laid around the Shunsei
Maru to assist with manoeuvering the ship clear of pinnacles and reefs. Ball also
blasted outcrops to produce a clear channel to the open sea and about 300 tons of
coal and heavy materials were jettisoned in order to lighten the ship (MacBolt 1976).
By ballasting various compartments to raise and lower its draft at each extremity
during a six hour operation and by using the ship’s winches the Shunsei Maru was
successfully refloated during the spring tide of 5 April after three weeks of work.
The Shunsei Maru was then slowly steamed out and anchored offshore to allow the
salvors, who had not slept for three days, some rest. Even then they almost lost
the ship as it began to drift back towards the reef while they lay exhausted. A crew
of twenty men from the station under Captain Sinclair with MacBolt as engineer
took the ship down to Carnarvon for minor repairs. Then after being joined by a
radio operator and two experienced Scottish engineers who were sent up to assist
Macbolt they proceeded to a dry dock in Surabaya under her own steam arriving
three months after the initial stranding. There it was handed over to her original
Japanese crew who had been sent down to take over the ship. Later in the year
Macbolt received a letter of thanks from the Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Line, another
from the Sydney branch of the ship’s agents Yamashita & Company of London, and
also a money order to Åí50, then a considerable sum. This was sent from the Captain
of the Chofuku Maru ‘for services rendered’. One letter read
We are writing you this letter to express and convey our sincere thanks for your
best endeavours and kindness you showed toward the unfortunate crew to
comfort them or to give them facilities for salvage and repatriation. Although the
ship and the cargoes were to be abandoned the crew was very happy and grateful
that none of them had any accident and all safely arrived at Japan toward the
end of March and went back to their respective happy home[s] ( Reproduced in
Macbolt, 1976).
Tenders were called for the purchase of Chofuku Maru, but none were received (West
Australian, 2/5/1931).
A tragic sequel to these events involved the well known ex U.S. Navy submariner
Tom Snider. He was lucky to been invalided off the USS Harder during the war and
he was apparently devastated when it was lost with all hands off the Phillippines.
After the war Snider stayed on and married a West Australian to eventually become
famous for his work on many wrecks around the coast including the Liberty Ship
Michael J Goulandris (1944). He also searched for the wreck of the SS Pericles (1910)
off Cape Leeuwin and recovered much of its cargo of lead ingots. Later Snider lost
his life in a plane crash near Exmouth. He had flown there with the intention of
examining the former American submarine refuelling base at Onslow, to recover the
copper and copper alloys on the Chofuku Maru and possibly to salvage the anchors
and chain from the Shunsei Maru. MacBolt, though keen to accept Snider’s invitation
to join them on the survey was prevented from doing so and appears lucky not to
share his fate ( MacBolt, 1976). Partly because of Snider’s untimely death, Chofuku
Maru and the Shunsei Maru anchors and chain were never salvaged. They remained
virtually untouched until the Shunsei Maru anchors were located by W.J. Moffett in
1972. In September 1974 they were inspected by Museum photographer Pat Baker
assisted by P. Barrett-Lenonard who described the ‘most notable feature of the site’
as
a length of heavy barred chain lying E–W across the seaward side of the reef top
and some distance further comprising 100 metres. On the reef top, or East end, of
the line the chain was found attached to an iron-stocked Admiralty patent-type
anchor in 4m of water whose shank length was approximately 2.45m. At the west
end a larger anchor (approx 3m shank) with hinge type flukes [a close stowing
anchor] was attached lying in 9m depth . . . The chain has been overgrown in
places by the living coral. Two additional anchors were located lying in line with
the aforementioned anchor on the reef top, one to the south and one to the north.
Also on the reef top near the anchors coils of heavy wire rope were noted. No
evidence of other ships fittings was noted.
In May 1977 D.J. Morrissy and G.A. Rykers reported a steamship wreck in the
Point Cloates vicinity to the Museum. They described it as 50–60m long, lying in
15–20 feet (c.6m) of water approx 3–4 km offshore. It was described as being on the Ningaloo Reef broken up with no superstructure, a large propeller having a 4m
diameter with 4 blades, drive shaft, steam engine, with 4 winches and 2 boilers. Two
years later, in 1979 a team led by Barry Paxman reported a steamship wreck at the
entrance to Norwegian Bay. It became known as the ‘Norwegian Bay Unidentified’
and for a while the two reports were believed to be of the same vessel.
Both wrecks were inspected in May 1980, by a team led by M. McCarthy and
reports were filed. The different sizes of the remains, the location of each wreck
and the number of boilers and grates per boiler recorded in the Lloyds registers
led to the identification of the Morrissy and Rykers find as the Chofuku Maru and
‘The Norwegian Bay unidentified’ as the SS Zvir. It was lost in 1902 while in a cargo
of sugar (McCarthy, 1980a &b). The wrecks which had been ‘fixed’ using sextant
bearings and angles from shore were subsequently relocated and then fixed to
modern GIS and DGPS parameters by J. Green. In 2009 both wrecks were inspected
by a team led by Ross Anderson and the reports filed (Anderson, this volume).

The remains of the Chofuku Maru are extensive and make for an interesting dive. As
it is in deeper water off the outside reef it can be dived in conditions unsuitable for
the Ningaloo UNID, Benan and Correio da Asia with swell up to 1.5–2.0 m. The
overall length of the wreck site is 98m oriented with the bow 45. northeast, and it
has its starboard side lying against two large coral bommies on the outer reef. The
stern area in 8m depth has the rudder, sternpost and steering quadrant, four-bladed
propeller (with only three blades visible) and propeller shaft with its plummer blocks
and thrust block near the engine. The propeller shaft has broken in two places at the
plummer blocks. The double bottom of the vessel has broken into at least three main
‘platforms’ over the uneven reef bottom with scattered hull plating and deck beams.
The amidships section has the collapsed triple expansion engine lying on its port side
and the two boilers, one of which has eroded and collapsed and the other is intact.
A donkey boiler is visible on the starboard side just astern of the engine area. The
forward section and bow is in deeper water up to 10m, and features deck winches,
capstan and a steam windlass, hawse pipes and the partially intact stem/ bow.
The site was inspected on 11, 12 and 18 May 2009 with GPS points of bow and
stern recorded and a site plan, video, photogrammetry and photomosaic of the site
produced.
The wreck site and associated relics of the Chofuku Maru, and anchors related
to the SS Shunsei Maru stranding and salvage are protected by the Commonwealth
Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976.

Marmion, William Pearse, George Pearse, William Owston","John Pringle","Sold as a wreck Lacepede Island, got off and repaired, re registered March 1878","N","7.90","","Ballast","1207","The Cingalee was a 3-masted barque, built by the Dundee Shipping Co. with one deck and an elliptic stern, launched in May 1872. The vessel was copper fastened and sheathed with yellow metal. The figurehead was a Cingalese, or Sri Lankan. In mid-February 1877 a severe cyclone struck the Lacepede Islands wrecking many of the ten vessels anchored there to load guano. The London registered Cingalee was deliberately run ashore in an endeavour to save it and its crew. The vessel, high and dry on the island, was bought for £170 by J. & W. Bateman at an auction held in Fremantle. By September the barque had been refloated, temporary repairs made, and sailed to Fremantle where it underwent a thorough refit by the shipwright, Robert Howson. On 19 March 1878 the vessel was sold to William Edward Marmion (32 shares), William Owston (16 shares), and the brothers William and George Pearse (16 shares), trading as Pearse, Owston & Co. They then registered the vessel at the port of Fremantle (No. 3/1878). On 28 February 1880 each of these owners sold some shares in the barque to John Pringle, master mariner of Fremantle, Pringle then owning 21 shares.
The Cingalee had been laid up for about twelve months when it was chartered by the government to carry from Fremantle 200 tonnes of railway line and some timber for the Bunbury to Blackwood railway. The charter was for six months at £200 per month, with the charterers to insure the vessel for £1 200, the owner to pay 10% premium. It was under the command of John Pringle.
THE LOSS
The Cingalee anchored at Bunbury on 5 June 1887. The topgallant yards were sent down on 6 June, and on 7 June the vessel began discharging part of the cargo into lighters. On 11 June, having discharged sufficient cargo to reduce the draught by about 18 inches (0.46 m) the barque was, at the request of the government, moved to the jetty to discharge the remainder of the cargo. Before going alongside, the master let go the best bower anchor at a measured distance of 110 fathoms (200 m) north-east of the north-west end of the jetty. All the buoys which had been in the vicinity of the jetty for use by vessels had been removed, consequently Captain Pringle was using the ship’s anchor to hold the vessel steady and prevent it pounding against the jetty.
On 15 June the wind increased from the north-east and Pringle hauled the barque off the jetty using the best bower anchor, and on the following morning, with the wind more northerly, the port anchor was let go, the vessel then swinging to its two anchors at a distance of about 80 m east of the north-west extremity of the jetty. The wind continued unabated, veering to and fro from north-north-east to north-north-west. On the morning of 18 June because of the big seas the Cingalee struck bottom lightly a number of times, so the master had some of the cargo shifted forward to raise the stern, which in the northerly wind was that part of the vessel in shallowest water. A third anchor, a heavy kedge, was let go from the jibboom end on a four inch (100 mm) rope, and all anchor cables hauled in to hold the vessel in place.
Port regulations laid down that vessels should send down fore and main topgallant masts, but Captain Pringle did not comply with this order until the afternoon of 18 June, when the wind was still blowing strongly from a northerly direction with occasional severe squalls. At about 4.00 p.m., while the crew were sending down the masts, with the fore topgallant mast already on deck, the port anchor cable parted. The crew hauled the cable in, intending to fasten another anchor to the end, but before they could do so a heavy squall caused the starboard cable to also part. The rope from the third anchor on the jibboom was slipped and Captain Pringle ordered sail set so that he could beach the Cingalee in an effort to save the crew and vessel. The barque ran aground 400 m east of the entrance to the Leschenault Inlet at about 6.00 p.m., but on its way had scraped over an old wreck (possibly that of the Midas), damaging the hull. It came to rest with its bows facing the sea and the stern embedded in the sand.
The master kept sail on so that the Cingalee would stay firmly aground and to keep it from rolling, but at 8.00 p.m. he had the crew furl the sails. By midnight the water had risen in the hold to the same level as the sea outside.
At about 9.15 p.m. a spokesman for the crew, able seaman H.G. Wright, came aft with a demand that the crew be put ashore, claiming that as the vessel was stranded the master had no power to keep them onboard. This request was impossible to comply with at the time. All hands were discharged a month later on 18 July 1887.
INQUIRY
After a Preliminary Court of Inquiry on 24 June charges were laid, and Captain Pringle appeared before a Court of Inquiry made up of Resident Magistrate William Dyer Cowan, Thomas Hayward, Justice of the Peace, and Captain Evans of the Lothair, nautical assessor. The court, held over five days commencing 21 July 1887, found Captain Pringle guilty of negligence in anchoring too far to the eastward of the jetty and in water that was too shallow; of not letting go the starboard anchor further out, in line with and before coming to the jetty, so that the vessel could have been hauled off into deep water, and therefore into a safer position; of not signalling for assistance when the port anchor cable parted; and failing to have a fourth anchor ready to let go. He was also found guilty of not taking all necessary preparations for bad weather on 15 June when a gale was indicated by the falling barometer, in that he did not send down earlier the fore and main topgallant masts, and did not put springs on the anchor cables. They decreed that his certificate should be suspended for three months. However the only nautically competent member of the inquiry, the nautical assessor Captain Evans, disagreed with the finding regarding the second charge. As the court required a unanimous decision their findings regarding suspension were nullified by this dissention, but Pringle was ordered to pay the cost of the court, which was £12.
INITIAL SALVAGE
On 29 June 1887 a survey conducted by a board consisting of Harbour Master Captain Charles Tylden Russell, Captain William Owston, Captain Hayes and G.T. Mason condemned the Cingalee as a total wreck. The first consideration was to salvage the cargo which a Mr. Risely, on behalf of Mr. Keane, contracted to recover (West Australian, 1 July 1887: 3f). The vessel was then stripped of all its gear, which was taken ashore and sold over the three days of 1–3 August. The stripped wreck was blown up with explosives, much of its timber being used by Bunbury residents for firewood. The ship’s bell from the Cingalee was bought by Thomas Hayward, later coming into the possession of Mrs Wallace of Turkey Point who, in 1938, loaned it on trust to the Bunbury High School.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
The ship’s bell from the Cingalee was used for many years as a school bell at Bunbury Senior High School. It was stolen in 1979, but a newspaper article in 2000 states that the bell had been found and returned to the school (South West Times, 18 May 2000: 13).
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
The Cingalee had been used in the guano trade and during this time was caught in the exceptionally destructive cyclone of 1877, which sent so many vessels to the bottom at the Lacepede Islands. It was one of those which, though damaged, was able to be repaired and put back into service.
REPRESENTATIVE (8)
The Cingalee is representative of the many vessels which were used to carry railway construction material to the South-West at a time when the network of railways was being laid. Ironically it was these railways which were to bring about a significant reduction in maritime activities.

The vessel was copper fastened and sheathed with yellow metal. The figurehead was a Cingalese, or Sri Lankan. In mid-February 1877 a severe cyclone struck the Lacepede Islands wrecking many of the ten vessels anchored there to load guano. The London registered Cingalee was deliberately run ashore in an endeavour to save it and its crew. The vessel, high and dry on the island, was bought for £170 by J. & W. Bateman at an auction held in Fremantle. By September the barque had been refloated, temporary repairs made, and sailed to Fremantle where it underwent a thorough refit by the shipwright, Robert Howson. On 19 March 1878 the vessel was sold to William Edward Marmion (32 shares), William Owston (16 shares), and the brothers William and George Pearse (16 shares), trading as Pearse, Owston & Co. They then registered the vessel at the port of Fremantle (No. 3/1878). On 28 February 1880 each of these owners sold some shares in the barque to John Pringle, master mariner of Fremantle, Pringle then owning 21 shares.
The Cingalee had been laid up for about twelve months when it was chartered by the government to carry from Fremantle 200 tonnes of railway line and some timber for the Bunbury to Blackwood railway. The charter was for six months at £200 per month, with the charterers to insure the vessel for £1 200, the owner to pay 10% premium. It was under the command of John Pringle.
THE LOSS
The Cingalee anchored at Bunbury on 5 June 1887. The topgallant yards were sent down on 6 June, and on 7 June the vessel began discharging part of the cargo into lighters. On 11 June, having discharged sufficient cargo to reduce the draught by about 18 inches (0.46 m) the barque was, at the request of the government, moved to the jetty to discharge the remainder of the cargo. Before going alongside, the master let go the best bower anchor at a measured distance of 110 fathoms (200 m) north-east of the north-west end of the jetty. All the buoys which had been in the vicinity of the jetty for use by vessels had been removed, consequently Captain Pringle was using the ship’s anchor to hold the vessel steady and prevent it pounding against the jetty.
On 15 June the wind increased from the north-east and Pringle hauled the barque off the jetty using the best bower anchor, and on the following morning, with the wind more northerly, the port anchor was let go, the vessel then swinging to its two anchors at a distance of about 80 m east of the north-west extremity of the jetty. The wind continued unabated, veering to and fro from north-north-east to north-north-west. On the morning of 18 June because of the big seas the Cingalee struck bottom lightly a number of times, so the master had some of the cargo shifted forward to raise the stern, which in the northerly wind was that part of the vessel in shallowest water. A third anchor, a heavy kedge, was let go from the jibboom end on a four inch (100 mm) rope, and all anchor cables hauled in to hold the vessel in place.
Port regulations laid down that vessels should send down fore and main topgallant masts, but Captain Pringle did not comply with this order until the afternoon of 18 June, when the wind was still blowing strongly from a northerly direction with occasional severe squalls. At about 4.00 p.m., while the crew were sending down the masts, with the fore topgallant mast already on deck, the port anchor cable parted. The crew hauled the cable in, intending to fasten another anchor to the end, but before they could do so a heavy squall caused the starboard cable to also part. The rope from the third anchor on the jibboom was slipped and Captain Pringle ordered sail set so that he could beach the Cingalee in an effort to save the crew and vessel. The barque ran aground 400 m east of the entrance to the Leschenault Inlet at about 6.00 p.m., but on its way had scraped over an old wreck (possibly that of the Midas), damaging the hull. It came to rest with its bows facing the sea and the stern embedded in the sand.
The master kept sail on so that the Cingalee would stay firmly aground and to keep it from rolling, but at 8.00 p.m. he had the crew furl the sails. By midnight the water had risen in the hold to the same level as the sea outside.
At about 9.15 p.m. a spokesman for the crew, able seaman H.G. Wright, came aft with a demand that the crew be put ashore, claiming that as the vessel was stranded the master had no power to keep them onboard. This request was impossible to comply with at the time. All hands were discharged a month later on 18 July 1887.
INQUIRY
After a Preliminary Court of Inquiry on 24 June charges were laid, and Captain Pringle appeared before a Court of Inquiry made up of Resident Magistrate William Dyer Cowan, Thomas Hayward, Justice of the Peace, and Captain Evans of the Lothair, nautical assessor. The court, held over five days commencing 21 July 1887, found Captain Pringle guilty of negligence in anchoring too far to the eastward of the jetty and in water that was too shallow; of not letting go the starboard anchor further out, in line with and before coming to the jetty, so that the vessel could have been hauled off into deep water, and therefore into a safer position; of not signalling for assistance when the port anchor cable parted; and failing to have a fourth anchor ready to let go. He was also found guilty of not taking all necessary preparations for bad weather on 15 June when a gale was indicated by the falling barometer, in that he did not send down earlier the fore and main topgallant masts, and did not put springs on the anchor cables. They decreed that his certificate should be suspended for three months. However the only nautically competent member of the inquiry, the nautical assessor Captain Evans, disagreed with the finding regarding the second charge. As the court required a unanimous decision their findings regarding suspension were nullified by this dissention, but Pringle was ordered to pay the cost of the court, which was £12.
INITIAL SALVAGE
On 29 June 1887 a survey conducted by a board consisting of Harbour Master Captain Charles Tylden Russell, Captain William Owston, Captain Hayes and G.T. Mason condemned the Cingalee as a total wreck. The first consideration was to salvage the cargo which a Mr. Risely, on behalf of Mr. Keane, contracted to recover (West Australian, 1 July 1887: 3f). The vessel was then stripped of all its gear, which was taken ashore and sold over the three days of 1–3 August. The stripped wreck was blown up with explosives, much of its timber being used by Bunbury residents for firewood. The ship’s bell from the Cingalee was bought by Thomas Hayward, later coming into the possession of Mrs Wallace of Turkey Point who, in 1938, loaned it on trust to the Bunbury High School.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
The ship’s bell from the Cingalee was used for many years as a school bell at Bunbury Senior High School. It was stolen in 1979, but a newspaper article in 2000 states that the bell had been found and returned to the school (South West Times, 18 May 2000: 13).
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
The Cingalee had been used in the guano trade and during this time was caught in the exceptionally destructive cyclone of 1877, which sent so many vessels to the bottom at the Lacepede Islands. It was one of those which, though damaged, was able to be repaired and put back into service.

Breadth:	15.68 ft (4.8 m) (Dickson, 1996)/18.7 ft (5.7 m) (McKenna, 1959, Henderson, 1988)
The Citizen of London was built by George Payne, and had one deck and a counter stern. It was owned by the builder (32 shares) and his son, Arthur Lewin Payne (32 shares). The vessel was built on George Payne’s property near Capel, disassembled and transported by horse and wagon to the Vasse property of James Forrest, where it was reassembled and launched. The schooner was under the command of Arthur Payne, even though he did not have a master’s certificate. The Citizen of London carried cargoes to ports between Augusta and Geraldton but was not insured.
THE LOSS
On 20 August 1880 the Citizen of London was taking on sandalwood at the Bunbury Jetty under the supervision of George Payne. However, a strong surge was making loading difficult. When it had taken on about 20 tonnes of sandalwood the vessel was thrown with extra force against the jetty. A rope fender was cut in two and some of the planks below the waterline were stove in (West Australian (Supplement), 31 August 1880: 2a). The schooner was hove from the jetty and, using the dinghy, attempts were made to stop the leak by fothering with blankets. When this proved unsuccessful because the rush of water into the hull carried the blankets with it, the crew used the flying jib in the same manner. However this was also sucked in by the rush of water. Payne then got sail on and sailed the Citizen of London, with five feet of water in the hold, onto the beach about two miles north of the jetty. Lines were taken from the mastheads to the shore to prevent the vessel from rolling.
INQUIRY
The master of the Citizen of London was censured at the subsequent Court of Inquiry for showing lack of judgement in not warping his schooner up alongside the jetty until it grounded. The court considered that by running it ashore Payne had exposed the vessel to becoming a wreck on the beach in the event of any subsequent gales.
INITIAL SALVAGE
On 21 August 1880, despite considerable surf on the beach, the crew discharged the cargo of sandalwood from the Citizen of London, and shifted the now lightened vessel 5–6 m further in towards the beach. Some nineteen months later in early May 1882 a report stated that repairs had been made to the damaged hull, and that the Citizen of London had been shifted from its position on the north beach preparatory to its being refloated and taken to Lockeville for final repairs. Despite this report it was not salvaged, but abandoned and eventually broken up using explosives.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
TECHNICAL (2)
The builder of the Citizen of London, George Payne, was a carpenter and joiner but not a boat builder. In essence he prefabricated this fairly large schooner. Its loss would appear to have been caused by the inexperience of the crew rather than any weakness in the construction.
SOCIAL (3)
George Payne had arrived in the Parkfield in 1841 as part of the Australind enterprise, and family tradition has it that he was always proud of having been a citizen of the city of London, hence his naming of the schooner.

 A three masted, 68 metre (223 feet) long, iron hulled ship   built in 1869 by Glasgow shipbuilders J. Elder and Company. Departed San Francisco  under Captain Phillip Jones with a cargo of 743,444 feet of Oregon timber and 3,638 doors.  Contemporary of Cutty Sark against which it once raced. After making a record passage to Western Australia in  90 days, approached Rottnest on the afternoon of 12 July 1899 in stormy weather including blinding rain and heavy seas. Sighted by the lighthouse keeper  the pilot was readied   and the assistant lighthouse keeper challenged the ship by lighting a flare-up at the base of the lighthouse, indicating the ship was  to stand off until the pilot arrived. Jones  mistook the signal for the international code as being from a pilot boat itself and that the ship should continue towards it (the pilot boat).  It  grounded on a reef 200 metres offshore  in what is  today  know as the City of York Bay on a direct line in towards the flare at the base of the lighthouse.
Captain Jones ordered the ship abandoned  and all 26 got into the boats and  stood a short distance off. As the ship appeared to be holding steady of the reef, Jones ordered a return to the ship.  Eight men re-boarded  and 11  including Jones were drowned.  The seven  in the remaining  boat   got ashore and walked to the  lighthouse to raise the alarm. The remaining   eight men on the ship were saved.
Jones was blamed, but an outcry and concern about the signalling procedures  resulted in an investigation into the harbour and pilot services of the colony and  the committee exonerated  Jones.[
The owners claim for damages of £7,000 from the  government was settled out of court in early 1903. Though the hull was abandoned the  timber was purchased   by a Perth syndicate who also bought the cargo from the Carlisle Castle  wrecked on the same night.
The wreck lies in c 7 metres of water on a reef bottom with the bow facing to shore.  Discovered  by Barry Martin of the UEC, an anchor  was recovered by the Blue Water Wanderers in  1959 (1961?) and is now on exhibit at Rottnest  and was   fitted with a wooden stock. Another was recovered by the same club assisted by the Army and is on exhibit at the Flying Squadron Yacht Club at Nedlands

the vessel bearing W by S, distant 4 1/2 miles. from Rat Island
The Cochituate was built in the north-east of the United States of oak, pitch-pine and hackmatack. The barque had two decks and was copper fastened.
THE LOSS
The Cochituate, commanded by G. Harbands, struck the reef known locally as West Reef, to the west of Rat Island in the Easter Group of the Houtman Abrolhos about 3.00 a.m. on 14 June 1861. The vessel went on the reef while in stays, i.e. while in the process of tacking. Although having had gales for several days prior to the wrecking, the wind was light when it struck the reef. The ship quickly half filled with water and within an hour began breaking up.
The crew left the barque in the two ship’s boats, the captain, second mate and three crewmen in one and the first mate (Mr Devries) with six crewmen in the other. The impact of the vessel on the reef had broken the helmsman’s shoulder. Not knowing of the presence of the settlement at Champion Bay the two boats headed south close to the coast, but on the second day after leaving the vessel, rising winds caused them to abandon the boats, either ‘near the Arrowsmith River, a little south of Dongara’ (Henderson, 1988: 43) or ‘at Cockleshell Gully’, a little north of Jurien Bay (newspaper account and WAM File MA-56/72). As they landed Captain Harbands’ boat was swamped, losing all the provisions that were in it. On foot the skipper and his party continued southwards, living off dead fish and birds collected along the beach. They met Devries’ group at the end of the first day, and camped together on the beach. The following morning the second mate and six men started walking along the beach, leaving the captain, mate and three men waiting for an improvement in the weather which they hoped would enable them to launch the boat. The skipper was said to be ‘sickly’ and one of his party was described as ‘an old man, too infirm to travel’ (The Inquirer and Commercial News, 3 July 1861: 2e.) The weather did not abate, so on 18 June they also commenced walking towards Perth.
The second mate’s party crossed the Moore River on a makeshift raft of logs. Here they killed a dog and an extra allowance of the meat was given to John Barlish, a Dutchman, to enable him to travel ahead and seek aid, as the whole party was getting very weak. He reached Fremantle about midnight on 30 June.
A Police party organized by Mr Hogan was immediately sent to search for the survivors and on 1 July the Police found the mate and his men. The following day the captain and the remaining men were found by a search party led by Mr Dewar about 10 miles (16 km) south of the Moore River, and taken by horseback to Dewar’s house, where they remained for three days before travelling on to Perth.
INITIAL SALVAGE
When they abandoned the wreck of the Cochituate the crew took very little with them. John Wellard purchased the wreck of the Cochituate and sent a salvage party aboard two cutters, the Speculator and the Mystery, to the wreck site. A line was taken from the wreck’s mizzen mast to the reef and set up taut. By means of a flying fox along this a great number of salvaged items were landed from the ship (The Inquirer and Commercial News, 2 October 1861: 2e).
Some salvaged goods, which included a live pig, 28 casks of salt meat, 13 spars, a set of sails, and other bits of rigging gear, was trans-shipped from the Mystery to the schooner Favourite for shipment to Fremantle. The pig had survived without food or water in its sty on board the wrecked Cochituate for about three months. As it returned to Fremantle the Speculator also recovered the two abandoned boats and a chronometer that had been left with the boats on the beach.
The Acting Collector and Receiver of Wrecks, Leonard Worsley Clifton, stated in a memorandum of 11 July 1863 to the Colonial Secretary:
I demanded and received Ad-Valorem duty upon valuation, of all the material from the ‘Cochituate’ that was brought to Fremantle (CSR Vol. 515/43).
SITE LOCATION
According to the salvage party that Wellard sent to recover as much as possible from the wreck, it lay 4½ miles west by south from Rat Island. This would place it on what is locally known as West Reef. There is a report that during the early 1930s Fred Cato, caretaker of a canning factory on West Wallabi Island, saw a wreck on West Reef, which may be that of the Cochituate.
More recently divers from the Western Australian Museum found and photographed a length of bronze railing in the area where the Cochituate is believed to have been wrecked.","NO","USA","12","","","","N","56/72","N","N","","","","","","","","2923","Medford","Melbourne","Boston","Singapore","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

"Cock of the North","1879/05/07","20 km north of Geraldton","","","","","N","4.40","","","A 745","The Cock O’ The North was a ketch-rigged motor vessel built by Charles Blunt (McKenna, 1959) or Bluat (Dickson, 1996) in Geelong, Victoria, in 1903. It was carvel built and had an elliptical stern. The first owner was John Nelson, shipowner of Colac in Victoria. He sold it to the Nor’West Fishing Co. Ltd of Perth in January 1904. The registry was then transferred on 12 January 1904 from Melbourne to Fremantle. In May 1905 John Nelson, shipowner of Perth (possibly the man who had previously owned it) bought the Cock O’ The North from the Nor’West Fishing Co. Ltd. Nelson then sold the ketch to Frederick George Winter, Morris Brandt, Charles Nelson and Bertie Winter in November 1905. Totty states that the Cock O’ The North was owned by Florance Constantine Broadhurst at the time it was wrecked.
THE LOSS
No details are known of the wrecking, which occurred near the mouth of the Oakajee River.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
SOCIAL (3)
Broadhurst was a well-known business man in the Geraldton area. He was the son of Charles Edward Broadhurst (see Xantho), and successfully carried on many of his father’s entrepreneurial ventures. However, in 1907, the loss of the Ione followed by the loss of the Cock O’ The North must have been a severe blow.

"Colonna (ex Sierra Colonna)","17836","Off Rock Dunder","Richardson, Duck & Co, of Stockton","Adelaide S.S.Co.","","By gunfire by aircraft from the City of Perth RAAF Squadron","Y","11.58","","","AUS 1034"," Sierra Colonna was built by Richardson, Duck & Company (yard No. 246) for the Sierra Shipping Co. Ltd, Liverpool, UK, and launched on 18 April 1878. It had two decks, one bulkhead and was cemented. It had a poop 15.2 m long and a forecastle 11 m in length. The ship was used on the run from the UK to Burma. In 1903 it was sold to J.A. Henschien of Lillesand, Norway, and renamed Colonna. The last voyage under that company’s ownership was in 1914 with a cargo of timber for Port Adelaide. On arrival the ship was sold for use as a coal hulk. In 1917 the buyer, The Adelaide Steamship Company Ltd, took the hulk to Albany to replace the J.L. Hall. This had been condemned, stripped and then sunk by gunfire the previous year (see entry). The winches used to handle the coal on board the Colonna were powered by a 25 HP steam engine with a vertical boiler. The hulk was moored about 4 cables (730 m) from the end of the Deep Water Jetty.
THE STRANDING
During the early morning of 16 September 1943 the cargo of coal in the fore hold of the Colonna caught fire. There was a strong south-west wind blowing at the time, and this coupled with a lack of tugs meant that there was little chance of moving the hulk. The donkey boiler was immediately fired to get steam to operate the windlass if this should be required. At about 1.00 p.m. the harbour-master, Captain Griffiths, inspected the burning vessel and as the wind was lessening he decided to try and get the burning Colonna alongside the jetty. This would enable fire fighters to more readily fight the blaze. As there were still no tugs available some of the small motor launches such as the boom defence vessel, the Quarantine Department’s launch, the harbour-master’s launch and a private launch owned by Lionel Austin, were used. By 3.00 p.m. the wind had dropped sufficiently for the attempt to be made. The Colonna’s anchor was taken out close to the jetty, and by heaving on this with the donkey engine and windlass, and the aid of the launches, the hulk was brought alongside the jetty by 4.45 p.m.
While water was sprayed on the burning coal in the forward hold, two gangs of waterside workers began off-loading coal from the aft hold. This work carried on all night, considerably hampered by the volumes of smoke pouring out of the vessel. By the next morning so much water had been pumped in, that it was considered the Colonna would sink alongside the jetty. Lieutenant Hutcheson, the naval officer in charge at Albany, borrowed a pump from the Shell Oil Company depot which was used to pump out the water being poured onto the burning coal. Despite these efforts by the evening of 17 September the fire became more intense.
The following morning things were worse. Captain Miller, The Adelaide Steamship Company’s representative arrived by train from Perth, and by mid-morning had decided that the only course of action was to flood the Colonna. Consequently the anchor was taken away from the wharf, and again with the assistance of the small launches, at about 2.00 p.m. the pulling of the Colonna away from the jetty was commenced. At 5.30 p.m. a severe north-westerly squall struck, pushing the bow of the hulk, so that, dragging the anchor, it swung into a position approximately at right angles to the jetty, bow close to the jetty piles. Water was continually being pumped onto the burning coal, and at 8.30 p.m. the hulk settled on the bottom. There was still an estimated 2 000 tons of coal on board.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The Colonna had settled on an even keel, and being made of iron it was considered that, despite the fire, the hull was probably sound. The Commonwealth Salvage Board sent two petrol driven pumps to Albany from Perth but the owners decided to make their own salvage attempts. It is presumed that the company employed local people to undertake this task, as the Colonna was reported as having been salvaged by Lionel Austin, his son Stan Austin, and two divers, Nobby Pannet and Jack McBride. It then continued to serve as a hulk in Albany until 1952. On 31 October of that year, at the end of its useful life, the Colonna was towed to a position one mile west of Rock Dunder and sunk in 32 fathoms (58.5 m) of water by Mustang fighter planes of the RAAF using rockets and bombs.
A chest of drawers from the captain’s cabin of the Colonna is in private ownership in Perth. After World War II some spars and a section of one of the masts were used for derricks at the whaling station in Frenchman Bay.","NO","UK","","2007/03","","5.95","N","2010/0030/SG _MA-195/72","Y","N","-35.03843","","72.02","","118.1393783333","","","78785","Stocktonon Tees UK","","","","DGPS","Not protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

Hocking","Leak, wheat swelled","N","4.10","","Wheat",""," Comet was built by Thomas William Mews at his Fremantle yard, and had one deck and a counter stern. The owners were John and Charles Tuckey. The schooner left Bunbury with a cargo of wheat for Fremantle on 12 September 1893, under the command of Captain William Robinson Hocking, with mate John Henry Hocking (brother of the captain), and crew of John Byrne, P. Yelland and Charles Copp. Earlier in June the Comet had been driven ashore near Quindalup (see entry) and, although got off, was subsequently known to have leaked. The agent for the schooner was John Joseph Higham of Fremantle.
THE LOSS
Two weeks after leaving Bunbury the Comet had not arrived at Fremantle, and the newspapers reported that a quantity of wreckage had been found about 20 miles (32 km) from Mandurah. The wreckage consisted of spars, a bowsprit, hatch coamings, hatches and a dinghy, and all were supposed to belong to the Comet (Inquirer, 29 September 1893: 11c). There was no sign of any survivors. A police search of the coast found further wreckage, including a mast, cabin, several beams and a tank, some ten miles (16 km) further south. The vessel was last seen by people on board a steamer, one of whom was George Butcher, a local pilot. A severe storm was blowing at that time. The wreckage was subsequently found offshore of where the Comet was last seen.
INQUIRY
Although the results of any Court of Inquiry are not known, it was supposed that the leak may have caused the wheat to swell and thereby damage the hull, which resulted in the Comet foundering. Comparisons were made with the loss of the cutter Gem, sunk near Rottnest Island some 16 years earlier by a cargo of swelling wheat.
SITE LOCATION
Divers from the Western Australian Museum in May 1995 carried out an inspection on a wreck on Bouvard Reef, and speculated that the material may have come from either the Bee or the Lass of Geraldton, both lost in this vicinity (see entries). The GPS position of the site inspected is 32° 50.492 S and 115° 35.166 E, almost ten miles south of Cape Bouvard. This site seems to fit best with that of the wreck of the Comet as Captain O’Grady stated that the Lass of Geraldton was wrecked 10–11 miles south of the Peel Inlet.","NO","WA","5","","All (5)","1.40","N","405/71","N","N","","","19.50","","","","","75318","Fremantle","Bunbury","Fremantle","Fremantle","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

It had a straight stem and a counter stern. Launched in January 1896 the vessel was not registered until 20 October 1902. Coolgardie was used in the pearling industry in the north-west of Western Australia for many years with the registration number B146. An owner who had used it in 1897 for pearling was Sweetman’s son, F.J. Sweetman. It was still involved in the pearling industry in 1913, but there is little information on the years between 1913 and 1937. In that year the Coolgardie was owned by Mrs May Robinson of Claremont, and had been leased by Frank Casparson for two years. The schooner left Fremantle on 25 January 1937 on a fishing expedition to Cape Leeuwin, and was expected to return in 14-15 days’ time. There was a three weeks’ supply of food and ice on board. The crew consisted of the skipper, Frank Casparson (39), Martin Martinsen (65) and Robert Sharpen (about 45). At the time of its loss the Coolgardie was 41 years old, which is a remarkable age for a small vessel which had had a hard working life. Its builder, Chamberlain, had a high reputation for workmanship and in this case it must have been well deserved.
A cyclone, described as one of the worst on this part of the coast in over 80 years, struck the area where the Coolgardie was last sighted at about 6.00 p.m. on 10 February 1937.
THE LOSS
On 13 February Mrs Casparson reported to the police at Fremantle that the Coolgardie was four or five days overdue. Initially the boat and crew were not listed as missing, but when there was no sight of vessel or crew a few days later, enquiries commenced. The Coolgardie had last been seen when it was fishing in company with the Swansea (Charles Axel, skipper) off Cape Bouvard on Wednesday 10 February. Around 3.00 or 4 .00 p.m. Axel noticed a storm advancing from the north and headed to Bunbury for shelter. His last sighting of the Coolgardie was to see it attempting to beat into the wind towards Fremantle.
Commencing on 18 February the newspapers were reporting that police from Yarloop, Harvey, Bunbury, Busselton, Margaret River and Albany were patrolling the coastline searching for the missing schooner and its crew, and one reported that ‘all hope has been abandoned for the fishing lugger Coolgardie, which left Fremantle on January 25 and is feared to have foundered in the recent storm’ (Daily News, 25 February 1937: 7f).
However on 24 February Joseph Strong and Jack Richardson reported the finding of part of a cabin top on the beach 14 miles south of Bunbury and 2 miles north of the Capel River to Sergeant Molloy at the Busselton Police Station. After examining the section of wreckage and the compass which had been attached to it, Sergeant Molloy began enquiries. Initially it was presumed to be off the fishing boat Wattle, which had lost its cabin when it was wrecked at the Busselton Jetty in the cyclone two weeks previously (see section). However the Wattle’s owner said it was not the cabin off his boat. Further investigation proved it to be part of the cabin off the Coolgardie. It was made of jarrah, painted white inside and dark green on the outside, and measured some 1.83 m square and about 66 cm deep. There were three rectangular porthole openings which had been boarded over, and a mast hole in the centre 20 cm in diameter. Molloy’s informants were Frederick Rodriguez and Martin Rolda, both of whom had previously worked on the Coolgardie, and knew it well. A thorough search of the coast for many miles found no other wreckage associated with the missing schooner.
In his report to his inspector Sergeant Molloy stated: ‘fisherman and others informed me that the cabin may have floated a long distance before reaching Capel’ (SRO 430 Item 942/1937). He also added that he had been told that the Coolgardie was heavily ballasted and old, and would have sunk very quickly when the cabin gave way.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The police at Fremantle returned the compass off the Coolgardie to Mrs Robinson, owner of the schooner.
SITE LOCATION
Divers from the Western Australian Museum in May 1995 carried out a wreck inspection on a wreck on Bouvard Reef and speculated that the material may have come from either the Bee or the Lass of Geraldton, both lost in this vicinity. The GPS position of the site inspected is 32° 50.492 S and 115° 35.166 E, almost ten miles south of Cape Bouvard. This site seems to fit best with that of either the wreck of the Comet or the Coolgardie, as it is some distance offshore. It has subsequently been found that the Bee was wrecked on the beach.
A small specimen of timber from the site was identified by Dr Ian Godfrey, Western Australian Museum, as being a Eucalyptus species, possibly jarrah or karri. This would seem to indicate a locally built vessel, such as the Coolgardie. The Lass of Geraldton was constructed of timber recovered from the wreck of the African, an English-built ship.","NO","","","","","0.98","","","N","","","","10.80","","","","","114484","Fremantle","Fremantle","Fremantle","Cape Leeuwin","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

Launched in June 1868 it had one deck, one bulkhead, two tiers of beams and was cemented. The barque had been built under special survey using heavier plating than that required by the rules. The owner in 1884 was G.M. Bushby, and the vessel was again registered at Liverpool. In 1900 the barque was sold to the Norwegian firm of Akties Copeland Island (Johan. Bryde), renamed Copeland Island and registered at Sandefjord, Norway.
The Copeland Island had been lying in Adelaide for some years when, in November 1902, it was purchased by The Adelaide Steamship Company Limited. In 1905 it was towed to Albany by the steamer Winfield for use as a coal hulk, arriving during the late evening of 27 March 1905. As a hulk it was always referred to as the Copeland. The winches were powered by a 15.9 HP steam engine fed by a vertical cross tube boiler, and there were three derricks.
THE LOSS
In May 1928, having served its useful life the hulk, Copeland was stripped of all fittings including the derricks, boilers and winches. It was then towed by the tug Awhina to a position off False Island near Cape Vancouver. Under the supervision of the harbourmaster, Captain Donaldson, explosive charges in the Copeland were fired, and the hulk sank within a few minutes in 15 fathoms (27.5 m) of water.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Two of the derricks (made from oregon timber) were later used as masts on the small steamer Silver Star at Albany.","NO","UK","","2007/03","","5.82","N","2010/0030/SG _MA-195/72","Y","Y","-35.0109966667","","53.77","","118.1694983333","","","58900","Harrington","","","","DGPS","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

"Correio da Azia","1816/11/25","Point Cloates","","Joao Nunes da Silveira","Joao Joaquim de Freitas","","Y","","","","1056","1817 Emilla was dispatched to salvage the Correio da Azia. Capt. Pedro Jose da Silva Loureiro, Pilot Luis Beltrao
  The Correio da Azia was ‘coming from Lisbon to Macau against weather, seas and wind, fire, shallows and coastal dangers and errors of maps’ (de Freitas 1816) when it ran aground on Ningaloo reef on 26 November, 1816. Established by the Portuguese in 1557 and returned to China in 1999, Macau was the oldest permanent European settlement in Asia. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, it was the pioneer mercantile settlement on the trade route from Europe to the Far East. Although the Correio da Azia was following an established route of the Portuguese China trade, the contemporary charts clearly underestimated the size of the Western extension of Point Cloates. This, combined with a number of mishaps including a fire in the binnacle which prohibited navigation by compass, may have contributed to the loss.
The survivors from the wreck set off in the ship’s boat stopping once further up the West Australian coast to make repairs to the vessel. The Captain’s account makes mention of the fact that no natives were seen, despite crew apprehension and that two of the crew were accidentally left behind. It was concluded that animals or natives had killed these sailors when they could not be found. Shortly thereafter, the ship’s boat was picked up by an American ship from Philadelphia, named the Caledonia and the survivors eventually reached Macau. A party was sent back in the brigantine Emillia in the hope of salvaging the wreck of the Correio da Azia, but no trace of the ship could be found.
There have been a number of documentary sources related to the Correio da Azia found in archives. The account of the loss by Joao Joaquim de Freitas, Captain of Correio da Azia was found by Steve Lubkemann of Brown University, at the Arquivo Historico Ultramarino in Lisbon, being part of a report filed by Manuel de Arriaga Silveira, Governor of Macau. This document dated February 1817, also describes the organization of the Emillia salvage expedition prior to the mission itself.
The second account was written by Luis Antonio da Silva Beltrao, a pilot of the Emillia, hired to chart the navigational dangers for the proposed salvage of the Correio da Azia. The report was published in Calcutta in 1818. At the Museum’s instigation, a copy of this document was located and purchased by the Western Australian Library Board in 1987. The account deals largely with issues relating to the longitude and plotting of Point Cloates, which was at the time a notorious navigational danger. This was especially important, for all charts of the region were actually based on those de Vlamingh produced in the late 17th century, While more recent charts were available, namely those of Flinders and de Freycinet; neither of these explorers had charted this part of the Australian coast, as the Portuguese and many others had thought (Scott 1914:195).
Therefore the information available in 1816 was a composite work derived from earlier charts, inherent with the navigational errors of that period. The Beltrao instructions mentions, but does not locate, the exact position of the site. The account also mentions how the Captain of the rescue ship Caledonia showed his charts of the coast to de Freitas who noted the longitude was 2º 25’ by the ‘London Meridian’ (Erskine 1998 after Beltrao 1818). This is a reference to the difference in longitude between Greenwich and Paris. While Greenwich was the Prime meridian by the end of the 18th century, some French cartographers insisted on defining longitude as east or west of Paris. The implication is that the Captain of the Correio da Azia was using a French chart of the Western Australian Coast (Erskine 1998:57).
The wrecking of a Portuguese vessel at Point Cloates in 1816 is also mentioned in the 1841 edition of The India Directory or Directions for Sailing to and from the East Indies, China and Australia and the adjacent ports of Africa and South America by James Horsburgh.
Found by Fugro Survey  in concert with J Green in 2004, the wreck was surveyed and identified, with partial excavation and further remote sensing analyses
 by the Museum led by Green.

"Cottesloe Unidentified","","200m inland of Cottesloe Beach, North Street","","","","","N","","","","","AN OLD WRECK.
Worlkmnen's Discovery.
Some time ago workmen making a drive for sewerage work in North-street,
North Cottesloe,. found the remains of an old boat wedged between two pinnacles of rock about 200 yards from the beach, and at a depth of 35 to 40 feet. The boat, which was quite small, was stated to be rivetted with copper nails
and only the corner of it was seen. Discussing the find yesterday Mr. L. Russell,
one of the workmen who helped to make the drive, said that in his opinion the
boat was only a small one and not a full-sized wreck. Its depth and distance from the beach convinced him that it had been there for hundreds of years.
The drive, or tunnel, was made through rock and shells that had been compressed into a consistency harder than diorite.
Explosives had to be used and in one of the explosions a quantity of rock and
shell wider than the width needed for the drive was dislodged. The rear corner of an old wooden boat was disclosed lying at an angle of about 45 degrees from the
line.of the drive and resting between two pinnacles of rock. As the boat was not
in the path of the drive, and there were no instructions to investigate further,
the work was continued and the whole channel eventually covered in.
The ship's boat described by Mr Russell is some distance farther north than
previous interesting finds made in the Cottesloe locality, including a ""dead eye,""
a block-like attachment used on old vessels as part of the ""chains.""' Dead eyes
of the type found were used on ships of ancient make. Coins and an old
cannon have also been recovered from the sea or beach at Cottesloe.

"Countess","1925","Between Geraldton and Point Cloats","W.F. Lawrence, Perth","South Perth Ferry Co. Ltd. sold to H.M. Govt. of WA in 1912","","Missing","N","4.50","","","","  Countess, originally named Coolanup, was built by members of the Lawrence family. Unfortunately it is often unclear as to which members of this family were actually involved in the building of any particular vessel. William senior worked with his two sons, William and Samuel. He had arrived in Western Australia by jumping ship (an American whaler) at Albany in 1841 at the age of 19, and was involved in boat building at his yard in Perth for the next 75 years.
Countess had a counter stern and straight head. Vauxhall of England, who also supplied the single steel boiler, built the 2-cylinder compound engine that had a stroke of 508 mm. This engine and boiler required an engine room length of 4.34 m. The speed attainable with the engine was 7 knots.
The builder stated that the original owner of the Coolanup was the ‘Fresh Food and Fish Company, Mandura’. This probably referred to the Murray Fish and Freezing Company situated at Yunderup at the mouth of the Murray River. Richards (1993) states that this company owned the Coolanup. The vessel was used in the Peel Estuary and Murray River before being sold to the South Perth Ferry Co. Ltd. That firm renamed the steamer and added two open cabins on its deck, one forward and one aft of the engines. An extra top deck above these made the Countess both top heavy and almost unmanageable when the wind increased.
The vessel, despite being built in 1897, was not registered until March 1905. This presumably was the date of sale and its future use as a ferry required that it be registered. At that time the South Perth Ferry Co. Ltd mortgaged it to Samuel William Copley, financier of Perth, for £13?000 at 7% interest. This mortgage was discharged on 4 March 1912, and the Countess was sold to the Government of Western Australia (the Fremantle Harbour Trust) on the same date. In 1921 the Government sold the steamer to Alf. E. Tilley & Co. Ltd for £115. Tilley used the Countess as a lighter to carry salt from Rottnest Island to the mainland.
As Dickson (1992: 36) describes the Countess as a barge when it was being towed to Point Cloates, it is probable that it had been stripped of its engine and its intended use was as a dumb barge. Being built for river work, it would have been unsuitable for use as a whale chaser or indeed any form of ocean going work under its own steam. However, with the engine and boiler stripped out there would have been much more internal space for its use as a barge. Although Alf Tilley was the skipper at the time it was wrecked, the steamer was actually under charter from his firm.
THE LOSS
According to various sources the Countess was being towed to Point Cloates by the whale chaser Fynd when it was towed under and lost. Another source of reliable information indicates that the Countess may instead have been returning south after completing a contract when it was towed under by the Fynd. The position where this happened is referred to as being ‘near Geraldton’ (Dickson, 1992: 36), and ‘between Geraldton and Point Cloates’ (Dickson, 1996: 133; Loney 1994: 120; McKenna, 1959, Book 4: 72).","NO","WA","","","","1.60","2 Cyl.

"Cricketer","1898/12/04","Irwin Inlet","","J.G. Cornish and Street, postmaster of Narrogin","Richard Barrett","Abandoned","N","3.41","","","","
The small cutter Cricketer, previously a pleasure boat based in Melbourne, was purchased by J.G. Cornish, the postmaster at Narrogin, in partnership with a man named Street. With a crew consisting of Thomas Hughes (skipper), Richard Barrett and Peter Johnson the cutter left Melbourne on 20 May 1898 for Fremantle. After weathering a number of gales and a shortage of provisions which resulted in the crew having to take shelter for periods up to three weeks, Thomas Hughes became ill and was put ashore at Fowlers Bay, South Australia. The other two men waited there fifteen days, but as Hughes’ condition did not improve they decided to continue the voyage without him. They encountered further headwinds, and off South East Island near Israelite Bay the deck began leaking badly, resulting in them having to pump the cutter’s bilges every hour.
Progress was very slow and by 3 October they were only near Esperance. Here the Cricketer was caught in another severe gale that blew the vessel 200 miles south of the coast. It took the crew four days to sail back to the coast at Bremer Bay. Here they sheltered for nine days until the weather improved enough for them to sail on 16 October for Albany. The following day, when only ten miles from that harbour another gale struck and the cutter was nearly swamped. It was hove to all night and the following day, needing constant bailing. When the gale eased the Cricketer was again steered towards Albany, where the tug Dunskey towed it to an anchorage. The anchor was dropped at 4.20 p.m. on 19 October. The voyage from Melbourne had taken five months.
THE LOSS
The Cricketer sailed from Albany in the afternoon of 28 November 1898 for Fremantle. There was a fair wind until Barrett and Johnson reached the vicinity of West Cape Howe, where strong westerly winds required them to heave to for two days in the lee of the cape. They then worked to windward as far as Rame Head, but the cutter continued to leak badly. As the water was gaining despite one bailing with a bucket and the other operating the cutter’s bilge pump as he steered, there was a danger of foundering. They saw a gap in the reefs two miles west of Irwin Inlet, and managed to steer the cutter between the reefs and beach it in the surf about 4.00 pm on Sunday 4 December 1898. The small cove is marked but not named on Admiralty charts, nor is it named in the Admiralty Pilot. However, it is marked as ‘The Gap’ on some local maps. Leaving the boat, the men waded ashore taking with them the only supplies they had, these being a loaf of bread and some tea and sugar. They searched for help, and after 54 hours of wandering they reached Wilsons Inlet. Here a fisherman named Bryant found them and took them to Denmark. From there they were taken to Albany, where they reported the mishap to the sub-collector of Customs, E. Troode.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The two crewmen thought that the Cricketer would be ‘quite safe on the beach, but the question is whether she is worth the expense that would be incurred in getting her off’ (West Australian, 9 December 1889, 5i). There is no record of the cutter subsequently being salvaged.
A newspaper speculated that at the time of the loss the Cricketer would not be covered by insurance as it was not under the command of a ‘certificated master’ (Albany Advertiser, 10 December 1898: 3b).","NO","Unknown","","","","1.47","N","","N","N","","","9.30","","","","","","","Melbourne","","Fremantle","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

"Croydon","1905","Hopetoun Harbour (Mary Ann haven)","Riley Hargraves & Co.","","","","N","4.89","","","1059","Croydon was built in Singapore by Riley Hargreaves & Co. It had one deck, a straight stem, an elliptical stern and one mast which was fore-and-aft rigged. The original owners were Henry Osborn (21 shares), Ebenezer Martin (18 shares), Francis John Meagher (9 shares) and Augustus Sandford Moe (16 shares). The vessel was not registered in Fremantle until 1899 (No. 9/1899) when these Western Australian joint owners sold it to The Adelaide Steamship Company Limited. The Croydon was initially purchased by the company for local work in the north-west. However, during 1904-05 it was used along the south coast, carrying mail and cargo between Albany and ports to the east. It carried no passengers.
THE STRANDING
There appears to be no report in the newspapers of the circumstances surrounding the stranding of the Croydon. In September 1905 an Adelaide paper reported on the annual general meeting of the Adelaide Steamship Company. The meeting was informed that ‘The Croydon struck a reef entering Hopetoun Harbour (WA) in February, and was abandoned to the Underwriters’ (Advertiser, 21 September 1905: 9a). While the fact that the Croydon struck a reef is not in doubt, but the date of the stranding is doubtful. During March 1905 the steamer is known to have been still voyaging between Albany and the small ports to the east. For instance, it was reported that it arrived at Hopetoun from Albany at 7.00 a.m. on 16 March 1905 (West Australian, 17 March 1905: 4a). Also it was not abandoned to the underwriters until at least mid-April. 
INITIAL SALVAGE
The stranded Croydon was got off the reef and repaired sufficiently so that on 8 April 1905 it could be taken in tow by the Adelaide Steamship Company’s own steamer Tarcoola (2 647 tons) for Adelaide, arriving on 13 April. At that time it was still owned by the company. On arrival at Adelaide it was to undergo repairs and an overhaul. Just over a month later the following advertisement appeared in an Adelaide paper:

In 1918 it was sold to the Huon Shipping & Logging Co., Hobart, and the following year sprang a leak and sank in the Savage River on the east coast of Tasmania.","NO","Singapore","","","","2.06","2 cylinder compound surface condensing steam engine 25 NHP, 125 IHP","195/72","N","N","","","23.17","","","","","101625","Singapore","Albany","Fremantle","Esperance","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

"Cumberland","1830/03/04","Augusta Cape Hamelin Minn’s Ledge","","Steel, Lamden and Company","Captain Anthony Steel","","Y","","","Coal and cattle","AUS 756, 413","The ship Cumberland was built of teak, iron fastened with iron knees, and had been sheathed with copper. It had two decks, and carried a proofed chain anchor cable as well as two coir rope cables. The vessel’s loaded draught was 17 ft (5.18 m). It was owned by Steel, Lamden and Company, and, under the command of Anthony Steel, had delivered a cargo of 16??000 bushels of wheat from Bombay to Sydney, stopping at Fremantle en route. The ship, under charter to T.G. Pitman, then took on a cargo of coal and some cattle at Newcastle, departing that port on 2 February 1830. Also on board was a printing press for delivery to Fremantle. Captain Steel had a crew of 49, including some Lascars, and two passengers on board.
THE LOSS
At sunset on 4 March 1830 the western extremity of Cape Leeuwin bore north-west, the eastern extremity bearing north-north-west. After rounding that cape the Cumberland started heading north too soon and, doing eight or nine knots in calm seas, struck a reef at 8.30 p.m. less than a mile from the shore. No indication had been seen of the danger, which left the ship stranded on a hard rocky bottom with 4.6 m of water at the bow and 5.5 m under its stern. The boats were hoisted out, and cargo and other items were thrown overboard in an attempt to lighten the ship. Within half an hour there were 19 inches (48 cm) of water in the pump well, and at 10.00 p.m. the pounding drove the rudder upwards, seriously damaging the stern timbers and the poop and cabin decks. An hour later the leak had increased, and the water in the hold covered the cargo of coal.
At 3.00 a.m. the following morning an attempt was made by Captain Steel to reach shore in the ship’s cutter. This proved impossible due to the heavy surf, so the boat returned to the ship. At daylight an examination around the vessel found that it was ‘lying on a rock about three times her own size with deep water all around, at the same time the leak had increased, and the water was above the lower deck beams’ (Bombay Gazette, 19 June 1830). A decision was made to abandon the Cumberland, and the crew left the ship at 5.00 a.m. Under Captain Steel and the chief officer the cutter and the ship’s longboat, with 29 of the crew and one passenger (Mr Wilson), made for Fremantle, arriving two days later. The other two boats from the ship, with 19 crewmen and the other passenger (Mr Shelley) landed near Cape Naturaliste. They then made their way to Port Leschanault where they were subsequently picked up by Captain Stirling in a government vessel, most probably the schooner Eagle, which was in Geographe Bay at that time. Three crewmen died of exhaustion before this group was rescued.
The passenger Wilson and some of the Lascar crew travelled onwards to Singapore aboard the Parmelia, and Captain Steel returned to Bombay aboard the Egyptian.
INQUIRY
There appears to be no record of an inquiry into the loss of the Cumberland. However the comments regarding the northerly setting current in this vicinity (see entry Hokitika) may also explain why the Cumberland was wrecked soon after rounding Cape Leeuwin.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The cutter and longboat were sold at auction, while the schooner Eagle was sent with the deputy harbour-master on board in the hope of salvaging anything of value. Only a binnacle and some buckets were recovered, the wreck of the Cumberland having completely broken up.
SITE LOCATION
There are two sites for the wreck of the Cumberland. The main site is on the reef where it struck, being one nautical mile offshore from Deepdene Beach, about 7 miles north-west of Cape Leeuwin. The secondary site, discovered in 1969, is at the southern end of Deepdene Beach where a large section of the hull (about 20 m long) lies in shallow water, having broken free and been washed to within 30 m of the shore.
SITE DESCRIPTION
There is little sand to protect artefacts at the primary site, and the swell would have quickly broken up and dispersed any timbers. However four anchors, two cannon, lead scuppers, at least ten grindstones, a stove, rudder pintles and gudgeons and various bronze fittings indicate clearly where the Cumberland struck. The site is subject to considerable surge even when the swell is quite low.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
Western Australian Museum expeditions to the Cumberland site led by Scott Sledge in 1983 and 1984 resulted in the recovery of many artefacts, including teak timber, rudder gudgeons, a sounding lead marked XXXI (being a 31 lb (14.1 kg) lead), many grindstones, blocks, pottery and glassware of the 1830s. The pottery includes pieces of a dinner set made by Spode called the ‘Indian Sporting Series’ depicting hunting scenes, in this particular case ‘Death of the Bear’. Two stones proved to be dripstones, a form of water filter carved from sandstone. Those recovered from the Cumberland wreck were made by convicts on Norfolk Island. Also recovered was an 18-pound cannon minus its trunnions and with the AVOC mark of the Amsterdam Chamber of the United Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oostinische Compagnie), which had probably been used as ballast. Some of these items are on display at the Augusta Historical Museum.","NO","India","50","1997/12","","5.20","N","2009/0098/SG _MA-413/71","Y","Y","-34.2966833333","","","","115.0403333333","","","","Cochin","Newcastle","Bombay","Bombay","GPS McCarthy Dec 1997 WGS84","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., (2012).

__________________________________________________________________________
Decr/ 6 Captn D. Ret. absent from sickness
At 6 A.M. Held a consultation of the sworn officers Messrs Blakely, Hillman, Murdock & Robson to decide upon what means were necessary for the recovery of the boat Amissing
Mr Murdoch – Being called upon to state when he last saw the boat saw not certain that I saw the boat after I made sail about 10 minutes before two oClock but on going forward at different times Mr Caley 6th Mate & the People stationed to look out dec-lared that they saw her light from time to time – A Short time after ½ past 3 I went forward when thought I observed the boat pretty close to us and the People on the forecastle thought the same immediately went aft and backed the  mizzen (paper missing-illegible) that the boat might keep a little ahead until daylight.
At 4 oClock couldn’t perceive the Boat. Had then no doubt of her being ahead
Mr Cayley 6th Mate was then called in – Stated that he saw the boat when the ship was hove too at ½ past two, thinks he saw something like her light after the ship was again bore up but cannot say that he saw the boat Mr Houlden Medi[?] said nearly the same as Mr Cayley
Dennis Mahoney/ Seaman Thinks he saw her last at ½ past three but is positive he saw her at ½ past one when Mr Murdoch Hailed her
John Palmer/ Seaman and one of the look out saw the boat abreast the ship at ½ Past one with fore and main lugs set but did not see her afterwards
Joh Lynn seaman and one of the look out stated the same but th(paper missing – illegible) he heard Mr Houlden say he saw the boat ahead afterwards.
From the several Depositions taken no Person could positively (paper missing – illegible) the Boat had been since ½ past one oClock or 10 Minutes after
The officers when called upon to state means they thought best to use for the recovery of the Boat – when Robson thought it would be best to make sail and steer NE by N for ten miles the course given to the boat & should the boat not be seen then to haul to the wind on different tacks – Turn over
Mr Murdoch thinks some accident must have happened to the boat not conceiving it possible for the boat to be out of sight in the space of two hours – Thinks it best to make all sail & steer NE by N for 10 miles
Mr Hillman Better make all sail an steer NE by N and thento haul to the wind on different tacks
Mr Blakely is of the same opinion
At 11 A.M. Held another consultation of the sworn officers to consider of what more could be done for the recovery of the Boat
Mr Robson is of opinion from circumstances that if no accident had befallen the boat she must be ahead of the Ship aand advised to stand on at noon NE by N under all sail till dark then to heave to and fire guns & burn blue lights until daylight
Mr Murdoch Is of opinion had better bear up and make sail at one and not before
Mr Hillman thinks it better to make all sail at noon and steer NE by N until dark &c &c
Mr Blakely Is of opinion had better bear up at noon to give us time should she be ahead to come with the Boat before Dark &c &c
At Daylight not seeing the Boat concluded her to be lost with the following unfortunate Persons

It had one deck. In early 1893 after arriving at Fremantle with a cargo of coal from Newcastle, NSW, the brig was chartered by W. D. Moore and Company to load jarrah paving blocks at Quindalup for London. It took on board a full cargo of 400 loads from Henry Yelverton’s mill. One report stated that the vessel was awaiting clearance papers which had been applied for two days previously (Inquirer, 31 March 1893). Another reported that, having loaded the cargo, the captain delayed departure for two days ‘in order to make everything snug for the long voyage’ (West Australian, 1 March 1893: 6e).
THE STRANDING
A gale struck from the north-east during the morning of Monday 27 February 1893. This increased in ferocity during the day, changing direction to northerly around 4.00 p.m. The strongest winds and highest seas seen in the area for twenty years drove the Dato ashore north-west of the jetty. The vessel lost its mainmast and came to rest about a kilometre offshore, where it was later condemned as a wreck.
INQUIRY
The Court of Inquiry into the stranding of the brig Dato resulted in the captain having two charges brought against him—the first, that of a breach of the Port Regulations; the second, that of not striking his topgallant yards when the barometer showed signs of the approach of a storm (Inquirer, 31 March 1893). He was let off with a caution but had to pay £8 court costs.
It was normal practice for vessels after coming to anchor to strike the top-hamper to reduce windage, so that any subsequent gales had less chance of driving the ship ashore. For instance the whaling barque Pacific of New Bedford had visited the Abrolhos Islands during July 1858 and one of the crew wrote:
As soon as our ground-tackle was secured, we struck the topsail and topgallant yards and the topgallantmasts, housed our mizen topmast, and then unbent all the sails, except the spensers [sic]: our objective being to present as little surface as possible to the action of the wind; thereby rendering our anchorage more secure (Whitecar, 1860: 270).
INITIAL SALVAGE
The wreck of the Dato was bought by Henry Yelverton and a local master mariner named Reid. After plugging several holes and pumping out the water, the jarrah blocks were off loaded. Further examination revealed that some of the planks were badly damaged, and these were replaced. The vessel was then sold as a hulk to W.D. Moore and Company, who in early 1895 had it towed to Fremantle by the tug Dolphin, where it arrived on 31 January. It was used for a period as an explosives store, and subsequently sank in Careening Bay, Garden Island, where it now lies.","NO","Finland","","1996/02

"Day Dawn","1886/07/14","Careening Bay","","Hansford Ward of Yatala","Captain John Ward","Went ashore, hogged at anchor","Y","8.60","","Timber","AUS 117","Day Dawn was originally launched in June 1851 in Massachusetts, USA, as the whaling ship Thomas Nye, built of oak, pitch pine and fir, copper fastened. As originally built it had two decks, a square stern, a scroll head, and was sheathed with tarred felt and Muntz metal. It was converted from 3-masted ship to barque rig, probably in 1864. At this time the length appears to have altered by about 0.6 m, a small measurement probably accounted for by either a slight difference in the method of measuring, or an alteration in the shape or style of the stern. The Otago Witness of 1 January 1864 lists the Thomas Nye as having arrived from Boston on 31 December 1863 under the command of Captain Jenkins. In 1867 the barque was registered in Sydney, the then owner being P. Jones. In 1872 the owner was H. Barne, but still registered at Sydney. By 1874 the registry had been changed to Adelaide, with the owner being James Smith. In 1877 it was sold to Hansford Ward of Yatala, South Australia, but maintained the same Port of Adelaide registry. Ward converted the vessel, now known as Day Dawn, to having a single deck but retaining the lower deck beams. The Adelaide Observer described the barque as the ‘best wooden vessel in the colonies…strong, tight and sailed remarkably well’ (McCarthy, 1979: 151).
The barque under the command of John Ward had delivered a cargo of sheep to Geraldton and then sailed to Quindalup, where it arrived on 4 July 1886, to load timber sleepers for Adelaide. About 50 loads of sleepers had been taken on board when, on 12 July, the weather deteriorated.
THE STRANDING
The bad weather continued for the next few days, and at 9.00 a.m. on Wednesday 14 July an anchor chain cable parted. At 1.30 p.m. despite efforts by the crew another cable parted, and the vessel was driven ashore ‘onto a rocky part of the beach west of Quindalup Jetty, and has since become a total wreck’ (Inquirer, 4 August 1886: 5d). The newspaper also reported that ‘as she is a soft-wood ship and old—thirty-five years—there is not much probability that she will ever be floated’ (Inquirer 21 July 1886: 4f).
The loss caused questions to be asked regarding the safety of Geographe Bay anchorages:
This casualty makes the third of the kind that has occurred in Geographe Bay during the past month, and gives rise to the question whether or not proper ground-tackle is provided (Inquirer: 21 July 1886: 4f).
A strict enquiry ought to be made into the stranding of these vessels [the barques Lake Simcoe, John C. Munro and Day Dawn], otherwise our port may be getting a bad name, without, probably, deserving it (Inquirer, 4 August 1886: 5d).
INQUIRY
At a subsequent inquiry into the loss of the Day Dawn the master was found to be free of any blame.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Although initially reported as a total wreck, the Day Dawn ‘lying on her bilge, hogged, with 40 ft of her keel gone and full of water’ (Inquirer, 15 September 1886: 4f) was sold for £140. The hull of the barque, refloated and stripped of gear, was resold for £1 000 for use as a hulk. It was towed to Fremantle in May 1887 by the steamer Rescue, the journey taking 22 hours. It was reported that the sale of the gear alone fetched a greater price than the purchaser had originally paid for the wreck.
In 1976 the wreck of the hulk Day Dawn was located during dredging operations in Careening Bay at Garden Island, and thoroughly investigated by members of the Maritime Archaeological Association of Western Australia on behalf of the Western Australian Museum. Because it was in the way of further dredging at the naval base of HMAS Stirling, the wreck was moved to a safer position.","NO","USA","","1996/02

THE VESSEL
There is much controversy regarding this wreck which was seen and described during the 19th and early 20th centuries, but which has now disappeared under the shifting sands of the beach berm which margins the Deadwater of the Wonnerup Inlet. The coastline at this point has changed considerably over the years. There is a possibility that at some stage the entrance (or possibly entrances) to the Deadwater were considerably deeper than they have been in historical times.
There are five eyewitness descriptions of this wreck:
Frank Thomas Gregory, 1861:
Recent Elevation of the Land.—Of recent changes of elevation there are but slight evidences. The numerous beds of oyster- and cockle-shells, just above the present sea level, of species still existent in the adjacent seas, tend to prove that there has been a gradual though slight upheaval of the coast since its first emergence from the ocean. To this may be added the fact, that the remains of a vessel of considerable tonnage have been discovered in a shallow estuary near the Vasse Inlet, and now quite shut out from the sea, which from its appearance, I should judge to have been wrecked more than two hundred years ago, during which period the land appears to have risen about two or three feet. This, together with the fact that, within the known limits of Western Australia there is not a single volcano, either active or extinct, nor any but slight evidences of volcanic agencies having been at work, goes far to prove that this portion of the Australian continent has undergone fewer changes than almost any other part of the world (Gregory, 1861: 482).
Leonard Worsley Clifton, 1876:
…it is evidently ancient and from the crutch of her boom, rings of the masts and a large grappling iron, found many years ago, near the wreck, which I have seen, she must have been a very large ship. George Eliot, then RM of Bunbury, and I together went to the spot some 30 years ago and the interest is that there is a sand hill of some height between her and the sea. I think that Mr. Eliot sent the crutch and the large fine fluked grappling iron, home. A large hemp hawser was dug out of the sand which had an encrustation of many inches thick round it, but the rope was so good that the finder used it to tie thatch on his house. I was informed by the late J.G. Bussell, J.P. that two ancient coins were found on the sand beach a few years ago, but failed in getting any further information (CSR 891/7, Worsley Clifton to the Colonial Secretary, 29 April 1876).
E.L. Grant Watson, 1910:
The ship was there alright, though not very much of her was above the surrounding swamp. At low tide we clambered aboard, the deck appeared to be intact, though all the hatches were full of mud, which had sifted in, tide after tide, and now probably filled every hollow space. The boat lay a good half-mile inland from the coastline, and a thick tangle of vegetation had grown into that region where the salt and fresh water met (Grant Watson, 1968: 75).
A further eyewitness account is given in the Port of Fremantle Magazine. Halls (1981) quotes Alfred Burt’s description:
The Deadwater was an almost landlocked pool and the old ship lay about half a mile from the shore on the landward side; there was a ridge of land between it and the sea beach. It stood two or three feet above the water and had a high stern built in the olden style.
Alfred Burt was a civilian draughtsman from Governor Weld’s staff who assisted Staff Commander William Edwin Archdeacon in coastal survey work in 1876. The Deadwater at Wonnerup was one of the areas surveyed, and Archdeacon noted that the sea in that area had receded ‘several chains’ since the first government survey, that by F.T. Gregory in 1846 some 30 years earlier (Halls, 1981).
The final description is by Edward Withers who lived and worked in the Lockeville area during the 1870s.
There used to be a wreck at the mouth of the Vasse River on the north side and when I worked at Lockeville I often saw the fluke of her anchor laying on the foredeck, it looked about one ton or more in weight but was about six feet under water. I do not think it was ever recovered as it would not have been of much value at that time (Withers, n.d.).
In the above descriptions the indication is of a large vessel, in three cases referred to as a ship, decked and with hatches, and of considerable tonnage. There has been speculation that the Deadwater wreck is the remains of the chaloupe, or longboat, from the French corvette Géographe lost on 5 June 1801, but none of these eyewitness accounts accord with an open longboat of the dimensions suggested in ‘Geographe’s Boat (1801)’ (see entry). It should also be noted that after the loss of the replacement longboat (built in Timor) in Bass Strait another longboat was built on the deck of the Géographe. Gregory also considers the vessel to have been wrecked more than two hundred years previously, rather than the sixty years before his paper was read at the Geological Society of London by one of its vice-presidents, Sir R.I. Murchison, on 22 May 1861.
There is also an entry in the diary of Henry Charles Prinsep dated 1 May 1869 in which he states:
Saw Reynolds [Joseph Gardiner Reynolds] who told me he had found the old ship in the Deadwater of Wonnerup (quoted in Halls, 1981).
Reynolds owned the property on which the wreck was supposed to lie, and as a consequence claimed a right to it when he learned that Thomas Bindloss had requested permission in 1876 from the Colonial Secretary to explore the wreck. Bindloss was successful in his request, but nothing is known regarding his success or otherwise in subsequently locating the wreck. In 1902 Reynolds also submitted a claim for salvage rights, which was granted. That Reynolds himself may have recovered some artefacts considerably earlier than his grant of salvage rights is suggested by a statement from George Julius Brockman just prior to his death aged 62 years in 1912 who claimed:
When a boy, I remember Mr Reynolds got relics from the wreck, knives forks and other things (quoted in Halls, 1981).
In 1902 Reynolds wrote in a letter to the Colonial Secretary that in 1860 he had ‘sent up all the iron work belonging to the wreck’ (quoted in Gerritsen, 1995), again suggesting that he had located the wreck and taken material from it.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
ARCHAEOLOGICAL (4)
There have been many searches during recent years for this wreck. People such as Thomas O’Brien and Greg Haywood worked together, other searchers included Rupert Gerritsen, Chris Halls and staff and students of the Maritime Archaeology Department of the Western Australian Museum.
Two cannon found in the 1970s were sometimes thought to be associated with the Deadwater wreck. These however are more likely to be the ones lost from the Grace Darling (see entry).
The discovery of the remains of the Deadwater wreck may solve one of the most intriguing mysteries to face maritime archaeology in Western Australia.
RARE (7)
The Deadwater wreck most probably pre-dates European settlement on the west coast, and is therefore of significance because of its age.

The vessel...had been bought by the Adelaide Steamship Company with the help of a government subsidy of £150, and stationed at Derby for use as a lighter. Having survived the cyclone of April 1887, after which it was described as a ‘condemnable wreck’, the  Derby was sold in 1889 to England and Miller. According to the vessel’s register, it was lost in a storm on Cossack Beach in 1894. As there seem to be no other reports of the loss, it is most likely that the Derby was a victim of the cyclone which struck Cossack area in January 1894. (Cairns & Henderson 1995: 225)
IA severe cyclone between 28 February and 1March 1889, caused the cutter Maud (ON 52232) to drive ashore after parting its chains, smashing the steam launch Tui on the way. Though the launch was completely broken up, the Maud, which came to rest high and dry, was repairable, despite two or three holes in the hull and a snapped-off mast. The lighter Derby was also damaged when driven against the jetty (Cairns & Henderson 1995: 135)

"Dolphin","1930","On the Eastern side of Penguin Island, 100 m offshore","A. & E. Brown, Birkenhead","","","","Y","5.37","","","","Dolphin was originally built as a 2-masted schooner rigged screw steamer by A. & E. Brown at Birkenhead in South Australia. It was carvel built on iron frames with one deck (with a break), and a round stern. It was powered by a 49 HP 2-cylinder compound steam engine. The first owner was The South Australian Fishing Company. In January 1888 it was purchased by David Symon, Cecil Henry Hammond and George Yorke Hubble, all of Fremantle, joint owners, but retained its Adelaide registration. The steamer was later bought by the WA Lighterage Stevedoring & Transport Co. Ltd who stripped it for use as a lighter. The lighter Dolphin was moored in Koombana Bay at the time of its loss.
THE LOSS
The newspapers reported that on the night of Friday 13 May 1904 the first of the winter gales struck the coast, bringing with it driving rain and very high seas. On the Saturday morning it blew even stronger, veering to the west:
The lighter Dolphin dragged till opposite the Solglyt wreck, where she parted her moorings and was driven high and dry on the north beach, from which position efforts will be made to dislodge her (Bunbury Herald, 16 May 1904: 2c).
INITIAL SALVAGE
The newspaper reported on 23 May that to that date no efforts had been made to get the Dolphin off the beach. The Register of British Ships for Port Adelaide has the notation that the vessel’s register was closed on 4 March 1913: ‘Vessel removed from Register at Owners’ request. Vessel still in existence—dismantled and used as a lighter.’ The Dolphin was salvaged and taken to Fremantle, where it was used as a Sea Scout training vessel for some years before being abandoned near Penguin Island. It sank in 1930, the remains lying 100 m from the north-west corner of that island.","NO","SA","","","","2.87","Two Screw, 49 HP","2010/0079/SG _MA-632/81","Y","N","-32.3026833333","","30.60","","115.6910833333","","","79336","Port Adelaide","","Port Adelaide","","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

The schooner Annie, 71 tons register, which arrived at Fremantle with wool and sandlewood from Maud’s Landing, visited the scene of the wreck of the pearling lugger Don Joseph, whilst in the Nor’-West. Captain Schroder, the master of the Annie states that he recieved instructions when in Carnarvon on the 10th instant to proceed to the wreck at Point Cloates, and leaving that port at 11 p.m. on the same date he reached the vicinity of the spot where the big ship was reported to be on shore, on the following evening. Next morning he entered the passage between the reefs and the shore, and instead of finding a large vessel ashore he was surprised to find only the wreckage of the lugger Don Joseph. The boat had drifted over the breakers onto the inside of the reef, on the edge of which she was lying on her beam ends, full of water. The vessel was a total wreck. Captain Schroder is of the opinion that by this time she has disappeared altogether. At the spot where the lugger struck there is an indentation in the line of the reefs, and the position being less exposed than elsewhere the breakers were comparatively smooth, otherwise the captain and crew would have had great difficulty in reaching the shore. He heard that those on board the lugger got ashore by means of a 10ft. dingey belonging to the Don Joseph, and that they were running short of water when a ‘ native from Hr. Carter’s station came across them, and guided them to that gentleman’s homestead. Captain,Schroder says that he “remained about the vicinity of the wreck for three days, but he saw no sign of the police boat, which as despatched from Onslow to Point Cloates.","Wrecked and sunk","13.00","","1899","108","Wooden","Fisheries","pearling","Shipwreck","Mid-West (Pt Cloates)"

Its first owner was William Frederick von Bibra of Dunorlan, Tasmania, farmer. There is also a record of it as having been owned at one time by John Wishart of North Adelaide, South Australia, and being registered at the Port of Adelaide in 1879. This reference also gives the tonnage as 70 (Jackson, 1879: 235). This agrees with the tonnage given by O’May who also says that at launching the vessel was schooner rigged (O’May, n.d.: 79). Duchess of Kent was first registered in Fremantle on 30 April 1894, although McKenna (1959) indicates that the registration was transferred to Fremantle by instrument dated 28 February 1893. William Reid, Master Mariner of Fremantle, bought it on 23 August 1894 and was the owner at the time it was wrecked.
THE LOSS
The Duchess of Kent was under charter to the Western Australian Government to carry explosives from Fremantle to Geraldton. The ketch was on its way back to Fremantle to pick up another cargo, and had departed Geraldton at 6.00 a.m. on 28 August 1895 under the command of Captain Ehlert. Note that this date indicates that the wrecking took place on 29 August, not 28 August as shown in official records quoted by Dickson and McKenna. During the evening of 28 August the wind strength increased. About 7.30 p.m. the mainsail and mizzen were reefed, but the mizzen sail was subsequently damaged. This was repaired, and later reset while the vessel continued south. About 2.30 a.m. on 29 August Captain Ehlert climbed the rigging in order to check what was causing the sharp increase in the swell. It was very dark, but he could see breakers on a reef to leeward. He was too close to wear ship but the vessel successfully passed over an outer reef. The anchor was dropped but the cable parted and the ketch struck the inner reef at Cervantes Island.
Morning light showed the Duchess of Kent to be hard and fast, and it was abandoned about 11.00 a.m. The crew made for the shore with little in the way of provisions, only a kettle of water and three wet loaves of bread. The next morning they set out southwards in the dinghy, but were forced to come ashore again because of the numerous reefs. They spent another miserable night on the beach in the rain, but their situation was somewhat improved when they caught a sheep which they cooked and ate. The following morning the crew located a shepherd who directed them to William Bashford’s sheep station where they arrived about 3.00 p.m. The next day they were taken to Moora via Yatheroo station, and then on to Fremantle.
INQUIRY
A preliminary inquiry into the wrecking of the Duchess of Kent exonerated the master, as the cause was found to be due to the stress of weather.

THE VESSEL
Nothing is known regarding the specifications of this vessel, who built it or where it was built. The fishing boat registration number was 12.
N.B. In some records this vessel is mistakenly referred to as the Gussie.
THE LOSS
Wrecked on the inner reef near Dongara. No detailed information is known regarding the incident. The Daily News stated:
Fishing Boat Wrecked off Dongara.
All Hands Saved.
During the forenoon the chief harbourmaster, Fremantle (Captain C.J. Irvine) received an urgent telegram from Dongara conveying the information that the fishing boat Duffie, registered No. 12, had been wrecked in the north during the recent heavy weather. The particulars to hand are very meager, but the wire mentions that all hands were saved.
The Duffie foundered on the inner reef off Dongara.
The West Australian the following day reported that: ‘As far as the Observatory records go back, this was the most severe disturbance that had visited the State during the month of August’.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
SOCIAL (3)
While little is known of the Duffie and no lives were lost during its wrecking, for some fishermen the misfortune must have had important social and economic consequences. This is an example of how easily the history of a district may be lost.
REPRESENTATIVE (8)
The Duffie was representative of the many fishing boats operating along the Western Australian coast in the early years of the 20th century.

Amstrong","Gale caused vessel to snap her cables, washed ashore and battered to bits in few minutes.","N","4.91","","stores and instruments, manure","1034","Dunskey was built by David Drake at Balmain, NSW, and launched in September 1891. It had one deck, a billet head, elliptical stern and was fitted with a derrick. Originally rigged as a schooner, the Dunskey had the rig removed in 1896 or 1897. The 2-cylinder compound engine had been built by Bowen McLaughlin & Co., Paisley, Scotland. The Dunskey was purchased from its Sydney owners by William Douglas of Albany on 3 September 1897, and registered at Fremantle (No. 8/1897). Douglas subsequently sold the tug to the Armstrong and Waters partnership, also of Albany, on 3 August 1901. It was not insured.
The Dunskey was chartered to take a railway survey party to Nornalup Inlet. There were six men in the survey party; McCrosky, Bennett, Hatton, Buney, Neilson and A.C. Langler (jnr). The crew of the Dunskey comprised the captain, Alexander Armstrong (snr), the engineer, Alexander Armstrong (jnr), O.S. Parish and P.J. Ingles, firemen, and G. Keyser, deckhand. Also on board, but just as a passenger, was an old sailor, Richard Burridge. The vessel was carrying nine tons of cargo, mostly stores, survey instruments and baggage for the survey party, but also included some stores for J. Thompson, a settler at Nornalup.
The Dunskey departed Albany at 2.00 p.m. Thursday 12 March 1917, reaching West Cape Howe at 5.00 p.m. that evening and anchoring in the lee of the cape. Sailing at 2.00 a.m. the following morning the vessel arrived at Nornalup at 9.00 a.m. expecting to be met by a motor launch. The launch was not there, and so a dinghy was sent up Deep River to search for it but found nothing and so returned. About 3.00 p.m. the son of the settler Thomson sailed a small boat to the anchored Dunskey, and took two of the survey party, Burney and Neilson, to get the launch. This was expected to take some six hours.
THE LOSS
The weather at that stage was calm, but soon the wind began to increase and at 5.00 p.m. a south-westerly squall struck and the Dunskey parted its anchor cable. The vessel was immediately headed for the open sea, only to find that the shock when the anchor cable had parted had strained the bows, consequently the Dunskey was leaking quite badly. As the force of the wind increased it was found that the pumps were not coping, so everything possible, including the cargo, survey instruments, stores and personal belongings, were thrown overboard.
The Dunskey was being driven eastwards, taking in water which, because of the lack of sufficient steam, the pumps were unable to cope with. By morning there was 4 feet (1.22 m) of water in the engine-room, and 6 inches (15 cm) in the stokehold. By this time the wind had veered to the south-east, making it a headwind for the voyage to safety at Albany. It became obvious that it was impossible to continue to port so the decision was made to run the vessel onto a beach. At 8.00 a.m. the Dunskey was run aground on the bar at the entrance to Wilson Inlet, striking bottom some 50 yards offshore:
A terrific surf was running and in a few minutes the tug was battered beyond recognition. Her funnel went before those on board could leave her, and soon afterwards the deck-house followed. Every man on board had a lifebelt, and there were some lifebuoys and planking. An effort was first made to get a life-line ashore and Parish made two unsuccessful attempts in this direction before young Armstrong tried, only to fail also. Hatton then jumped overboard and was carried on the top of a wave to the beach (The Albany Advertiser, 14 March 1917: 3h).
Eventually all those on board reached shore safely, although Armstrong (snr) was at first washed out to sea, and suffered considerably from the ordeal. Both he and Langler were washed ashore in a semi-conscious condition. Harry Morgan, a local settler, was at the beach with his family and helped the survivors ashore. He also sent his son in to Denmark to bring further assistance. Within half an hour of striking the Dunskey had completely broken up.
While the survey party remained in Denmark, the crew of the Dunskey returned to Albany by train on Monday 16 March 1917.","NO","NSW","7","","none","2.20","2-cylinder compound steam engine, 35 NHP","195/72","N","N","","","22.62","","","","","101022","Sydney, Balmain","Albany","Fremantle","Nornalup Inlet","No GPS","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

Schröder","Always visible, several attempts were made to get the vessel afloat*","Y","6.10","","Ballast","AUS 84, 1059","Dunster Castle was built by The Garston Graving Dock and Ship Building Company Limited, and launched in November 1909. Initially registered in Liverpool (No. 76/1909) by C.T. Bowring and Company Limited, it was clinker built with a round stern, straight stem and three bulkheads. The steamer had one deck, a well deck, a quarterdeck 11.28 m long, and a forecastle with a length of 5.49 m. The compound steam engine was built in Glasgow by Miller and Macfield Limited, and gave the ship a speed of 9 knots.
On 13 September 1911 the Dunster Castle was sold to George Bell of Melbourne, and registered in that port (No. 10/1911). It was insured for £4 000. The ship was being used to carry railway material for the Esperance-Salmon Gums railway, and this was its fifth voyage in this role. Under the command of Captain Frederick Schroder (also spelt Shroeder in some sources) with a crew of ten men, having off-loaded its cargo the steamer left Esperance to return to Albany at 8.30 a.m. on 4 July 1916. The weather was fine and the wind from the west-north-west was moderate. The vessel was riding high since it had very little cargo on board.
THE LOSS
About midnight on 4 July the wind increased to a gale from the north-west bringing heavy seas and causing the Dunster Castle to labour. About 5.00 a.m. the following morning the wind shifted to the south-south-west, and as the steamer was not making any progress Captain Schroder turned the vessel onto a south-east course intending to return to Esperance. At this time the ship was south of Margaret Cove and north-east of Rocky Island.  The strong winds caused the ship to set to leeward towards the land, and when nearing Butty Head it was found that, with the wind having now swung round to the south-south-east, the Dunster Castle could not weather the head. The course was therefore altered to the south-west so as to get further off shore as the gale was still blowing strongly with mountainous seas and heavy rain.
At 10.00 a.m. on 6 July, when about 14 miles south of Shoal Cape, the engineer reported that the bilge pumps were choked with coal and the water had risen over the stokehole plates, consequently he could not keep a full head of steam. As the pumps could not be cleared while at sea the master decided to seek shelter in Fanny Cove. In the poor visibility caused by the rain, Captain Schroder mistook his position and anchored with both anchors, but well west of the cove. Here, with the engines going slow ahead to ease the strain on the cables, they hung on until 7.15 a.m. on 7 July when the starboard cable parted, and the Dunster Castle dragged the port anchor as it drifted broadside towards the shore. To save the ship and crew the master deliberately ran it onto the beach about six miles west of Shoal Cape, where it came to rest head towards the shore without damage.
The following day some of the crew got ashore and obtained food and tobacco from the people at Moir’s farm. The following night rockets were fired to attract the attention of the State Steamship Service vessel Eucla, which then stood by during the night. Next morning the crew were brought on board the Eucla and taken to Esperance.
INQUIRY
The chief harbour-master at Fremantle investigated the incident and reported:I find:
(a) That the casualty was due to the exceptionally heavy weather, the vessel being in light trim, and water getting below, thereby preventing the engineer from keeping a full head of steam:
(b) that no blame is attachable to the master and officers, as every endeavour was made to bring the vessel into port when it was found that the weather was too much for her. No further action is necessary (West Australian, 11 September 1916: 5c).
INITIAL SALVAGE
Early attempts by the marine surveyor, Captain Arundel of Fremantle, to pull the Dunster Castle from the beach using the Western Australian Government owned ship Eucla were unsuccessful. During efforts by Albany diver Jack Schumann to get a line on board the wreck, the surf boat he was in capsized in the waves. The boat was pulled back to the Eucla by rope, leaving Schumann swimming for his life. He fortunately made it safely to shore. After some months of work Arundel abandoned any further attempts at salvage and the wreck was put up for auction.
On 23 November 1916 the Dunster Castle was sold by auction to E.G. Everett of Albany for £260. He contracted the Douglas family led by William Douglas of Albany to salvage the stranded ship. The Douglas family agreed to finance the salvage attempt, even though payment would only be made if they were successful. Those involved were William Douglas, his sons Clem and Ted, and Ted’s son Walter. By digging a trench round the stranded vessel, and using the steam tug Dunskey and the shallow draught steamer Silver Star, the Dunster Castle was floated. The engine was overhauled, however when it was started the stern tube seized as sand had entered it. Wind drove the ship back onto the beach.
It was to be another two years before they succeeded in again floating the Dunster Castle, but once more sand caused the newly freed shaft to seize. Water was therefore pumped into the ship in a deliberate attempt to have it sink in shallow water, in order to avoid it being washed higher on the beach. It was hoped to later pump out the ship, an easier task than pulling it off the beach. This also was not a successful manoeuvre as the ship slewed broadside on, and began to fill with sea and sand. Realising that salvage was impossible the Dunster Castle was abandoned by the Douglas family.
In mid-1919 two further attempts were made to salvage the ship:
It is stated that the Dunster Castle, still aground near Fanny’s Cove, after unsuccessful attempts to float her, is again to have the attention of a salvage gang (West Australian, 6 June 1919: 5c).
The first was made by a syndicate from Esperance using bullocks, and anchors buried in the cliff top in an attempt to drag the ship ashore. A line of wooden posts on the top of the cliff together with a large one-armed anchor, and some badly corroded pulley blocks and cables mark the place from where these attempts were made.
The second attempt was by two Norwegian brothers, Herbert and Lars Larsen, from the recently closed Norwegian Sperm Whaling Company in Frenchman Bay. With the help of the local diver, Jack Schumann, who had worked on the first salvage attempt, they built a timber bulwark 1.2 m high around the deck to keep out the waves, and then tried to pump out the ship. They succeeded in pumping out the stern area, including the engine room, but having then got the stern of the Dunster Castle afloat they could not get the sand out of the forward area, neither could they get the engine started, and the steamer went ashore once again, this time permanently.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Dunster Castle lies 90 m off the beach in Stoke Inlet, west of Shoal Cape.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck of the Dunster Castle lies on a west-north-west by east-south-east axis almost parallel to the beach with the bow to the eastward. Surf breaks continually over the site, and a strong 5-7 knot current running to the south-east makes any work on the site both difficult and dangerous. In January 1995 the wreck was inspected by Jeremy Green of the Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum. At that time a small section of the hull about 20 m in length was showing above the sand. Iron frames were visible, as was the top of the propeller, and the boiler and engine were still in place aft of the superstructure. The stem appeared substantially intact, and the windlass and some bollards were in position. Much of the iron plating had been abraded away by the large grained, very coarse sand, in conjunction with the strong current and heavy surf.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
During the wreck inspection a brass object, though to be the engine room telegraph, was recovered. A large brass porthole was also seen but was not able to be recovered as it was still bolted to the iron plating.","NO","UK","11","1995/01","","2.32","2-cylinder, double acting, vertical, inverted compound steam engine, 31 NHP, 240 IHP","2009/0103/SG _MA-54/95","Y","Y","-33.8502783333","","28.95","","121.0944983333","","","128012","Garston, Merseyside, Liverpool","Esperance","Melbourne, 1913-14","Albany","GPS 1995","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

off the coast of Wanneroo, some 50 km
north of Perth, on 3 September 1852, was
the sensation of the year. Not only did it
add to the list of unfortunate maritime
incidents for which the Western Australian
coast had become well known, but also
deprived a very bare colonial market of a
large portion of valuable cargo. The arrival
of the ship had been keenly awaited and
news of the disaster was beyond belief.
For the Department of Maritime Archaeology the archaeological investigation
of the Eglinton between 1971 and 1973 was a new departure into the study of
shipwrecks: it was one of the first wreck sites the Museum was able to study that
had not been disturbed by the looting activity of divers during the 1960s. The site
provided maritime archaeologists with the opportunity to develop strategies aimed
at solving the practical problems of carrying out archaeological work in Western
Australia’s high energy, shallow water, reef environments.
The Eglinton was built in 1848 at Quebec, Canada, by Scottish shipbuilder John
Munn (Jnr). Its first owner was the Liverpool merchant Duncan Gibb who quickly
sold the vessel to John Jaffray of London. He had the ship surveyed by Lloyd’s,
a thorough report providing detailed specifications of the vessel’s construction.
According to William Felgate, the London agent for the Eglinton, it was a ‘splendid
fast sailing ship’.
Although minimally represented in the archaeological record, artefacts
associated with the ship’s construction generally confirm the documented
specifications for the vessel. They form a useful sample with which to compare
contemporary shipbuilding practices in Quebec and Britain.
While much of the Eglinton’s cargo was salvaged, the artefact collection and
associated historical documents provide significant insights into the nature of
British–Australian trade in the mid 19th century: the type and quality of goods
being imported, marketing strategies and so on. In addition, the integration of
historical and archaeological data provides a limited perspective of the state of
development of the Swan River Colony in the 1850s","NO","Canada","","1991/01","2","5.50","N","2009/0107/SG _MA-416/71","Y","Y","-31.6408333333","","36.20","","115.659","","","","Quebec","Gravesend","","Fremantle","GPS","Protected Federal","SRO CSR VOL 245/109

Location:	Bunker Bay
   Electra was built in Fremantle as a 2-masted schooner with one deck, a counter stern and billet head. The first owner was John Bateman, ship-owner of Fremantle. He sold it to Francis Perrier Bell, also a ship-owner of Fremantle, in July 1898. A week later Bell mortgaged the vessel back to John Bateman for a loan of £300 at 8%. This mortgage was discharged one month later. In August 1899 the Electra was sold by Bell to Alexander Gordon, accountant of Broome, who in October 1901 sold the vessel to a consortium of Robert John Lynne, shipping agent, John Denny and James Leslie Denny, merchants, all of Fremantle. On 10 May 1890 the Electra had been blown ashore at Dongara, Edward Tuckett being washed overboard and drowned at that time, but the schooner was subsequently salvaged, repaired and returned to trading along the Western Australian coast.
The Electra had a crew of five and was under the command of Captain J. Anderson. It was carrying a cargo of timber valued at £260 for Millars in Fremantle, plus general cargo for J. & W. Bateman and other firms, and had departed Hamelin Bay on 17 March 1904. The vessel was worth £1 000.
THE LOSS
During the night of 17 March the Electra sprang a leak, and despite efforts by the crew it foundered in seven fathoms (12.8 m) of water 800 yd (730 m) from the shore at Bunker Bay. The crew’s efforts to save the ketch were hampered by the sails having carried away and the pump breaking. It sank within three minutes of them abandoning ship. They all landed safely and then proceeded to Busselton.
INQUIRY
A Court of Inquiry into the loss of the ketch Electra was held at Busselton on 21 March 1904 before A.R. Price, subcollector of Customs and E. Cross, J.P. It heard evidence from Captain Anderson and the mate, Neil Neilson, and then closed the case with no adverse findings against the master or crew.

"Eliza","1839/06/11","Lost South of Casuarina Point between Port Leschenault and Fremantle","","","","","N","","","","","The Eliza was built by William Hugh Edwards at his yard at the bottom of Spring Street in Perth for William Heard, owner of the Watermen’s Arms Hotel. It had a reputation for being fast, taking only 15 hours to sail from Fremantle to Bunbury and 16 hours for the return journey (Gazette, 2 March 1839: 1a). The cutter left Port Leschenault on 11 June 1839 bound for Fremantle.
THE LOSS
When, after 18 days, no word had been received of the Eliza it was presumed to have been wrecked and the crew drowned.
Serious apprehensions are entertained that the Eliza, a large boat, which left Port Leschenault about 18 days ago, is lost. The passage has been frequently made between that port and Fremantle in a day and a half; we fear therefore, that the presumption she has been wrecked is but too well grounded. Happily only two men, a boatman named Prince, and a man known by the name of Black Harry—and the cargo consisted of a few kegs of butter (Gazette, 29 June 1839: 2a).
The Eliza was wrecked on the Giant’s Causeway, just south of Casuarina Point. The two crewmen took to the vessel’s dinghy and made their way, according to one newspaper report, to the Vasse:
The two men in her were perfectly incompetent to the task of managing her but fortunately they escaped and although within a mile of the Elizabeth foolishly went to the Vasse. I have every reason to believe they thought themselves to the northward of Fremantle (Gazette, 25 June 1839, quoted in Henderson, 2007: 217).
According to another newspaper report published a week later, the men went to Bunbury:
The two men who were supposed to be lost in the cutter Eliza between Fremantle and Port Leschenault, have found their way to the latter port, being obliged to abandon the boat, a total wreck (Gazette, 6 July 1839: 3a).
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
SOCIAL (3)
It appears that the men in charge of the Eliza had little experience, so they were probably not the men who had made the fast passages mentioned above. The lack of reliable information on this wrecking reflects the difficulty of communication between isolated settlements and the Swan River in those early years.

THE VESSEL
Built in Calcutta of teak and launched in January 1832 the Elizabeth was purchased by L. & W. Samson for £1 600. It had a square stern and a female bust figurehead. In 1841 it was sheathed with copper, but the following year a Lloyd’s surveyor noted that the schooner was not in particularly good condition. The schooner had been blown ashore at Fremantle in October 1839, but was refloated. The vessel was insured for £800 when it was anchored in Koombana Bay, under the command of Captain James. It was taking aboard material salvaged from the American whaler North America, which had been wrecked some seven months earlier and was being broken up to obtain the timbers. On board the Elizabeth were 32 casks of oil belonging to Luke Samuel Leake, together with some of the timbers from the whaler and many bundles of barrel staves, known as shooks, the property of Captain Daniel Scott who was the purchaser of the wreck of the North America. The Elizabeth’s top-gallant mast had not been lowered, a practice normally carried out by vessels when at anchor to reduce windage should a gale arise.
THE LOSS
The Elizabeth was anchored when the wind increased and on 15 November 1843 the schooner parted its port anchor cable. The following evening the wind had turned to a gale from the north-west, increasing during the night until the morning of Friday 17 November, when the vessel’s starboard cable parted. Dragging the replacement port anchor, the schooner drove ashore at 2.00 p.m. It struck heavily, and then heeled over on to its beam ends with the deck facing the seas. The deck, which had been partly lifted by the casks of oil floating in the hold, was soon washed away. This caused the main mast to fall. The whole bottom of the hull on the port side was also smashed and then washed away. The crew got ashore by rope, but almost everything aboard the vessel, including the ship’s papers and the chronometer, was lost.
The barque Parkfield (Captain Whiteside) recently arrived from Sydney was anchored nearby, and its crew had quickly lowered a boat to go to the aid of the Elizabeth, but by the time they got near the schooner was in the surf zone and help by boat was impossible.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The advice sent by Marshall Waller Clifton to the owners in Fremantle was that the only items salvaged from the wreck of the Elizabeth were18 or 20 casks of oil which had washed on shore. The remainder of the casks still in the hold were expected to be stove in (Gazette, 25 November 1843). It is probable that many of Daniel Scott’s barrel staves were washed ashore after the Elizabeth broke up, and were therefore salvaged.
SITE LOCATION
This wreck of the Elizabeth has not been found, but as it was working near the North America (1843) it may be expected to be reasonably close to that wreck.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
The Elizabeth was used by L & W Samson for whaling, and during mid-1839 fished in the Geographe Bay area, striking eight whales but only taking four. This was one of the earliest whaling ventures carried out by settlers in Western Australia.
The Parkfield had brought out the Chief Commissioner of the West Australian Company, Marshall Waller Clifton, and the first body of settlers for Australind in March 1841.
ARCHAEOLOGICAL (4)
When found the wreck of the Elizabeth, built in India, will provide an interesting comparison with schooners built locally at about the same time.

It was built of jarrah around 1912 for the Frenchman Bay whaling station to transport barrels of whale oil to vessels in the harbour, and for ferrying supplies from Albany back to the whaling settlement. When not in use it was moored in the middle of Frenchman Bay. After being abandoned at its moorings by departing Norwegian whalers in 1917, the Elvie was driven ashore in a southeast gale in 1921 and filled with sand. Though mostly buried, the tops of the wooden hull frames and the stern and bow post are visible, the bow facing to seaward.

 The 116-ton two-masted wooden-hulled schooner Emma was built at Lowestoft in Suffolk England in 1859. It was 26.1m long by 6.2m broad, drawing 3.4 m and had one deck, a round stern and a ‘shield’ head. It’s registry was transferred to unknown owners at Fremantle in September 1865 and it was purchased by local shipowner and entrepreneur Walter Padbury in the following year. In its subsequent short career on the Western Australian coast Emma was involved in many incidents under its first two Captains; losing a man overboard on its first voyage; an anchor off the DeGrey River; colliding with a jetty at Champion Bay (Geraldton) and going aground at the Abrolhos and also at Butcher Inlet (Cossack). One of these incidents was blamed by one experienced traveller on its being fitted with compass taken from the ship Calliance which was wrecked at  Camden Harbour  a year or so before.  It was three times the schooner’s size and to some the compass would have proved completely unsuitable. Emma was also dismasted near the South Jetty in Fremantle after striking a sand bar. After being refloated she was driven back onshore and Figure 1 is possibly a depiction of Emma or of a very similar vessel ashore at this time. After being refloated Emma underwent a refit and had new rigging before returning back to the north (Halls, 1984; Henderson, 1988, 67-71). 
Early  link to the north west
In 1865, soon after the first of the European settlers landed in the north District of Western Australia, the West Australian merchant and pastoralist Walter Padbury purchased Emma to service his business interests and as a transport to his new pastoral lease in the north west.  He was an influential shipowner and had been one of the main agitators for settlement of the  ‘North District’—the name given to all the lands north of the Murchison River. The subject of a very positive report by F.T. Gregory in 1861, it contained not one known European inhabitant at the time. In the following year Padbury landed at Butchers Inlet in Nickol Bay and then sent a party under his manager and brother-in-law Charles Nairn overland to establish a pastoral ‘run’ on the  De Grey River. He then returned to Fremantle and was greeted with great enthusiasm and accolades as the pioneer of what was seen as a land of great promise.
Padbury had been quickly followed into the region by many other hopefuls, including John and Emma Withnell, who established the aptly-named Mount Welcome station, and as two examples pertinent to the  Emma story  John Wellard’s party chose a block later called Pyramid Station some 25 miles from Withnell’s and a group from Portland Victoria established ‘Indernoona’ station further inland.  Other than these small private concerns three ‘large’ companies in the North District also formed to take advantage of the very generous land regulations designed to foster  European settlement.  These were the Western Australian-based Roebuck Bay Pastoral and Agricultural Association, and two Melbourne-based groups the Camden Harbour Pastoral Association and the Denison Plains Pastoral Company. They intended to settle in the Kimberley region further north but were beset with so many difficulties that soon after landing, many of their settlers and staff left and landed at Nickol Bay where they joined those already in residence there. Then government in the form of the newly appointed Resident Magistrate, R.J. Sholl, also transferred south arriving from the failed Camden Harbour settlement in the barque Tien Tsin  with his son and secretary Trevarton, in February 1865.  In May he was followed into Nickol Bay  by  C.E. Broadhurst and his family with what were be  the advance guard of the Denison Plains Pastoral Company, many with family and some with very young children. They then settled in the region only to find it slowly sink into the depths of a severe and prolonged drought causing great personal suffering to all in the district. The desperate circumstances were only partly eased by the gradual development of a de facto township at the cluster of huts surrounding Withnell’s homestead. In August 1866 this became the township of Roebourne. Also relieving the shortages and some of the suffering were the arrivals of   Padbury’s cutter Mystery under Peter Hedland and his schooner Emma with stores and news from the south.
In preparation for its March 1867 voyage down to Fremantle under Captain Badcock, wool from the  defunct Roebuck Bay Pastoral Association was loaded together with eight tons of pearl shell belonging to a former Denison Plains Company man W.F. Tays. It was to be amongst the first shipments of wool and certainly the first large shipment of shell from the region, heralding a new era in the north and rendering Padbury’s Emma doubly important in the history of the north-west. 
Emma  and the pearling industry
Initially ‘dry’ pearling (or harvesting by beach-combing or wading in the shallows) was the fashion at Nickol Bay. By this means, the shallow beds adjacent to the shore were exploited at low tide. Apparently having prior knowledge of methods used elsewhere e.g. at  Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Tays and his partner Augustus Seubert, obtained a boat by entering a partnership with a pastoralist who had obtained the boat in exchange for fresh meat from an American whaleship.  Tays and Seubert had also located productive beds in shallow water close to shore, apparently with the aid of local Aborigines. These two factors were keys to success in this phase of the industry. Many followed their example and  in November 1866   Padbury sent a  large boat up in the Emma, for use in the pearl fishery.  He too proved successful. The record is very incomplete and a great deal of the activity at Nickol Bay at this time, would not have been recorded. All the officials, diarists and commentators, such as the Robert and Trevarton Sholl were stationed some kilometres inland. It also needs to be noted that many pearlers would have been secretive, desirous of anonymity or keen to establish a commercial advantage at this time.
With  12 tons of shell hidden on the coast, worth  around  £100 per ton landed in London (then the equivalent of a mid-level government servant’s annual wage), Tays informed Trevarton Sholl  and  apparently Charles Broadhurst, then the acting Resident Magistrate, that he had thoughts of going to Victoria to purchase a small craft and form a pearl fishing company.  He then took passage on board the Emma with much of that cache. 
The loss of the Emma
The schooner left  Mystery  Landing  in Butcher’s inlet (later renamed Cossack)  and cleared Tien Tsin Harbour (Port Walcott)  with its cargo and with 42 souls  on board including seven crew. On board were Tays; seven military pensioners from the Roebuck Bay Pastoral and Agricultural Association; Padbury’s brother-in-law Charles Nairn;  and the Resident Magistrate’s son T. C. Sholl. According to Chris Halls (1984),  there were also ‘four policemen in charge of two or three Aboriginal prisoners and three free natives’. Also on board were the master and one of the crew of the New Perseverance a  105 ton schooner that had run aground the shores of Butcher’s Inlet while carrying stock  and dismantled buildings from the Roebuck Bay Company  (Perth Gazette, 12/7/1867).  Being lightly loaded for its tonnage with only the shell, lugage and the wool in its holds, Emma also took on board an estimated 25 tons  of iron ballast ( R. J. Sholl diaries and Occurrence Books, 16/8/1867, CSR 603/ 92;108).
Given that a sailing voyage down to Fremantle took an average of  50 days and  that  the return trip back  north around 30,  Badcock had expected to be back  at Tien Tsin at the very latest after two months with the much-needed supplies  for the struggling settlers. After leaving Cossack on  3 March 1867 Emma disappeared with all hands, however, leaving the struggling settlement at Nickol Bay despondent at the loss of over a quarter of their number, near to starvation and without communications. 
With the drought deepening and famine setting in, Sholl sent a party overland to Champion Bay for a relief ship. In his private diaries and in his official despatches from this time Sholl records  both his grief at the loss of his son and also some of the speculation surrounding the disappearance  of the Emma and that of the  Cutter Brothers which was also missing at the time (Green,  this volume). Sholl noted in his reports that Emma had a ‘defective mainmast’  and  that Badcock had planned to sail around Ritchie’s Reef (the Trial Rocks off the Montebello Islands) before heading in to travel closer to shore.  He believed that Emma may have been dismasted in strong winds to then float helplessly at the mercy of the wind and seas.  In effect the ship, if it had not foundered at sea, could have fetched up on any part of the mainland, or on outlying reefs between Cossack and Fremantle.
The schooner Flying Foam was subsequently despatched and two days after its departure the 12 July edition of the Perth Gazette graphically illustrated the prevailing thoughts. 
 If she was wrecked on one of the island lying off the coast. some of the people would have probably  have safely gained the shore, but were that the case we shudder at the thought of the miserable lingering torture they must have gone through; allowing that all the stores of the vessel were saved, four months must have brough starvation, and perhaps perishing from want of water; death from immediate drowning on being wrecked is the more preferable death we could wish them
The schooner Heather Bell which arrived with a cargo of guano at  Sydney in August reported seeing wreckage on Bedout Island  north west of the DeGrey, sparking a search. Nothing was found.  Though all hope of there being survivors faded with the passing of time, speculation about the fate of Emma and its contingent continued for  well over a century.  It appears that parts of the wreck may actually have been sighted, however, for nearly a decade after the disappearance Charles Tuckey followed up a report from  a local Aboriginal man of three wrecks including one describing survivors from a wreck getting ashore only to be killed . The report read:
To ascertain if possible whether the wrecks really existed Mr Tuckey took his vessel inshore as close as he considered prudent after rounding the Cape and  by the aid of a telescope made out distinctly the ribs of a vessel lying on the  beach. The place is situated about 100 miles to the south of the Cape, between Point Cloates and Cape Cuvier, where a reef of fifteen to twenty miles in length and generally undefined on the charts, runs out to seaward.  
 Here the correspondent is describing the area north of Coral Bay. According to Halls, in concluding his examination of what he described as  ‘one of Western Australia’s most puzzling mysteries of the sea’  . . . nothing was done nor, it seems, were any steps taken to confirm his story by an official examination of the supposed wreck site’. (1984:23).  Three years later there appears to have been similar official inaction after the  5 November 1879 edition of the  Inquirer newspaper carried another more gruesome report thus:
Captain of the Schooner Nautilus, Mr  John Tapper, found on the beach between Shark Bay and Cossack, a portion of a vessel, evidently wrecked many years ago, the remains of which were strewn upon all parts of the shore. Close to the stern Tapper discovered no less  than 5 human skeletons, but no indications of the  name of the vessel or her destination’.  
As a result no trace of  the Emma or any clues to its fate were ever found until recent times. 
 A wreck believed to be the Emma is found
 In the late 1970s and early 1980s  the Museum received  three separate reports of  possible wreck  with off Point Maud  in the vicinity of Coral Bay. These were from local diver Serge Katarski and then by  Perth-based divers Jim Sellers, and Dean Whiting.  All three reports were believed to refer to the same site. Attempts to  join with  Mr Katarski soon after hisreport was received failed when he was forced to depart for New Zealand the day before the  Museum’s tream arrived. Eventually objects were brought in to the  Museum for identification  by Mr Sellers which  led Scott Sledge, the then Inspector of Wrecks, to conclude  that  the report ‘suggests very strongly that the wreck is that of a lugger [referring to]  ( YM [yellow metal] sheathing, tacks, small bolts  . . .  and part of  YM hard-hat diving dress collar with the word “FRONT” stamped into it). Given this tentative  and at the time quite reasonable assessment the report was not be given a high priority.  As a result and given  that an inspection of a such a remote site  would prove a very costly exercise, it was decided that (as per standard practice) the Museum would await the  gathering together of a suite of reports  in the region or en route to better use the funds available.
In August 1987 an informal report was relayed to staff  from a Brian Ingram of  Esperance. This was of a site off False Hill and Whaleback Hill that  he had been shown by a local spearfisherman. Ingram described it as being in 10-12 feet of very rough water, and seeing forks, cannons in slightly deeper water to the south, heavily encrusted timbers, ‘no coins’, anchors approximately  10-15 feet long approximately 20 feet apart, one an ‘Admiralty  type with ring on end’  in an area with lots of  ‘bombies’ in reef and sand  areas.  After being contacted  with a request to file a report of finding, Mr Ingram indicated that he felt that the wreck was closer to Coral Bay than he had earlier indicated, most likely at the  Katarski/Sellers/Whiting site.  Nothing further transpired as a result, though later   he was written to on the possibility he had seen another  significant site.
In  May 1988, utilising a sketch made from Mr Sellers’ description, a team lead by the author, who was then Inspector of Wrecks, located and examined  a wreck now understood to be the Emma. The remains were found  on a flat corraline reef north of Coral Bay at the entrance to  which at mid tide is covered  by c. 2-3m of water  but as the tide lowers becomes completely undiveable in the current and broken waves. The site was heavily encrusted in growth and concretions and is  so shallow that at low water spring tides it is expected that some of the anchors would become visible.  The wreck was found to lie on a E/W axis with the position of the bow indeterminate due to the location of  anchors and hawsepipes at either end.  There were seven anchors visible some with stocks stowed. The subsequent inspection report reads thus:
Iron stocked anchors  ranging in size from 1.2 to 1m overall.  Two of these have stocks set and a further two have each lost a fluke and appera to have been cargo or ballast. A substantial chain moundand heavily concreted  ballast/cargo  mound appears in three distinct sections each to a height of circa 1m Brocken or distored  knees are visible throughout. These are fastened  with copper through bolts to timbers once around 4 inches thick. One iron knee rider 3” by 1” in section keasured 2m from deck beam to the end which terminated inth ebilge. Two davits . .  . were recorded as were iron pump sections, piping, 2 hawsepipes one at each end of the site, and the remains of a crushed diving helmet. This was seen concreted to what apopears to be a pump section. Ballast stones are in evidence throughout. The concretions appear very rich with 1 lead ingot 10”x5”x3” visible, 2 book presses ( one a 400mmx250mm press), copper sheathing, one piece being a wool bale stencil with the  letter ‘P’ clearly visible. Iron bolts in much corroded form are also visible (c.20 x2.5mm). A diaphragm pump appears overgrown by coral close to a windlass 1.8m inlength. At a bearing of 210° from the cargo anchors and at a distance of  (x) m a small boat gudgeon, fastenings, a diving helmt, wing nut and other assorted  brass materials was recovered. 
A site plan was produced by the Museum’s chief diver Geoff Kimpton showing the major features and the objects raised for security, conservation and diagnostic purposes.  These were  the crushed diving helmet, sheathing fragment, a deck light, assorted fastenings and fittings, a ballast sample,  bottle, sherds, the small boat gudgeon,  the stencil letter, a length of chain with 4” x 3” x ¾” links and a bottle.   In examining the evidence, it was concluded  that:  
The  wreck is that of a mid-to late 19th century vessel, iron fastened in the deadwood and keel/keelsons and part  copper  and brass fastened eleswhere. Iron knees and in som eplaces knee riders were also use don the construction of the vessel. The two anchors with stocks set are more  an indication of vessel size than those apparently being carried as cargo. These indicate chain and fastenings sizes point to a substantial vessel of the 100-200 ton range most likely European built.  The presence of  the davits, small boat gudgeon, diving helmet, wool bale stencil?, lead ingot and 2 book presses are of significance and make a NW [north-west] destination or point of origin likely. Of the vessels lost in that trade only the Emma (867) nd Occator (1856) fit the size and temporal range indicated by the wreck. 
With only Occator and Emma of all the known losses fitting the remains inspected and with Occator known to have been lost further north,  it was concluded that this was the Emma. On the basis that it was one of  the most significant of all colonial wrecks in this State, the two  book presses on board were considered vital artefacts, with documents in th epossession of  T.C. Sholl possibly sealed within.  As a result it was recommended at the site be protected as the  Emma and that a further inspection/excavation be carried out ASAP with a view to removing the book presses and other attractive material, thus avoiding their irreplaceable loss.  The wreck was subsequently declared historic and  a reward of  $1500 shared between Dean Whiting, Serge  Katarski and Jim Sellers.  In  September  1992 a team led by Jeremy Green and including  photographer Pat Baker and diving conservators Ian Godfrey and  Jon Carpenter returned to the site fixing it at 23° 05.08’S., 113°44.15’E. In finding the conditions extremely difficult in the strong seas and swell then prevailing the recommendation to recover the two presses was not acted upon (J. Carpenter,  Conservation Report:14/10/1992).  Additions were made to the site plan nevertheless,  a number of loose items including part of a navigation instrument were raised; the site conditions were assessed and a number of  objects  including the presses further examined by the conservation specialists.  These were found to be ‘well preserved with minimal structural damage’. A timber sample  attached to a copper alloy fastening was also recovered and was later identified by Dr Godfrey as  Eucalyptus species.
Though not known at the time of writing the inspection report, research subsequently conducted into the pearling  and pastoral industries in the  north west showed that the ‘25 tons of iron ballast’ referred to by the Resident Magistrate in his reports was in the form of the anchors and ground tackle from the  New Perseverance which had been wrecked at Mystery Landing in Butcher’s Inlet  just prior to the departure of the Emma from that port. Apart from stabilising the Emma  the ground tackle was  intended as a ‘return freight’or ‘paying  ballast’ on consignment to Fremantle (R.J. Sholl, 16/8/1867, CSR 603/ 92;108). With seven anchors found on site, two (presumably Emma’s) with iron stock set and with chain ranged both along the keelson and in a chain mound, the evidence rendered the  hitherto tentative identification of the Emma conclusive.

HOPPER BARGE ARRIVES.
Line Parts in High Seas.
The story of the unsuccessful attempt by the hopper barge Empire Downland to tow a sister ship, the Empire Grassland through heavy weather in the
Indian Ocean was told at Fremantle yesterday when the Empire Downland arrived from Carnarvon. The Empire Grassland broke her tow when about 80 miles north of Carnarvon, and the Empire Downland had to leave her and proceedto Carnarvon to replenish her supplies of fuel, water and stores. Subsequently a search by the Empire Downland and by aircraft was fruitless, and the Empire Grassland is now presumed to have foundered.
The two vessels, which were intended for use by the Melbourne Harbour Trust left Singapore on December 20. They called at Christmas Island for fuel, and left there on December 27 with enough fuel to take them to Shark Bay. However,
very heavy weather was experienced and at the height of it the tow carried away and the Empire Downland had to wait for four days until the seas moderated enough for a new tow to be rigged. By that time the Empire Downland did not
have enough fuel to take her, with the other barge in tow, as far as Carnarvon. It was therefore decided o run for the lee of North-West Cape, where fuel was transferred from the Empire Grassland to the Empire Downland. Once again heavy weather upset the plans, the tow again parting. The Empire Downland then had to go alone to Carnarvon, and nothing more has been seen of the Empire Grassland. It was said yesterday that at no time during the trip had there been any crew aboard the Empire Grassland. The Empire Downland. under
the command of Capt. C. Fraser, carries a crew of 20, most of whom were formerly members of the crew of the steamer Panamanian, five of them being West Australians. Two triple-expansion steam engines drive the Empire Downland at a speed of about nine knots. Repairs to one of them will keep the vessel at Fre mantle for several days.
The hopper barge Empire Downland which left Singapore late in
December, 1946, with the barge Empire Grassland in tow, arrived
at Fremantle yesterday. When about 70 miles off Carnarvon she
abandoned the tow as her fuel and supplies were running low.
Aerial and surface searches have failed to locate the Empire
Grassland and she is now presumed lost.

"Emu","1925/07/28","Port Gregory","","Mark Margetic","Mark Margetic","","N","","","",""," e Emu was a fishing boat owned by Marko Marchetti also known as Marko Margetic. The Police Department Correspondence refers to him by both names and state that he was either an Austrian or Jugoslav, naturalized. He was 52 years old at the time of the wrecking. Burns (1978) names him as ‘Marko Margetic’.
THE LOSS
Margetic was attempting to sail out of Port Gregory through the ‘narrow passage’ as it was closer than the ‘wider passage’. That is, he was attempting to sail through Gold Digger Passage rather than heading further north to the wider Hero Passage. The wind dropped while he was only a boat’s length from the reef. As he went to drop the anchor, a westerly scud struck the vessel. This combined with the incoming tide drove the stern of the vessel onto the reef where it was severely damaged. The Emu sank but Margetic managed to get into his dinghy and was able to get ashore safely.

"Enchantress","1874/08/15","New Island, Brecknock Harbour","White","Australian Fishing Company","","Hit a reef","N","7.20","","Shell","","By the early 1870s, there were some eighty to a hundred small vessels pearling out
of Cossack and other anchorages to the west. In 1872, Roebourne Resident
Magistrate Robert Sholl reported that there were thirty-one 'ships' and fifty-two 'boats'
employed, and that the vessels ranged from 1 to 56 tons, the average being 10 tons.
(Sholl 1872, C.S.O. 714, fol.17) The fifty-two 'boats' were dinghies. The smaller
vessels could not stay at sea in heavy weather, and in 1873, the Inquirer saw the
number of shipwrecks as suggesting:
...the necessity of the early appointment of an official to see that the numerous
coasting craft are fit to proceed to sea, and that, moreover, they are properly
provisioned and in the charge of competent seamen. The recent lamentable
loss of life connected with our pearl shell fishery, and the way in which the
boats employed in it are almost without exception manned, calls for the prompt
attention of the Government (Inquirer 11/06/1873).
Bigger 'ships' were, however, being dispatched from the other pearling centres in
Queensland and overseas. Two such vessels were the schooners Flower of Yarrow
and Enchantress. Their owners, however, were not content to restrict themselves to
the well known pearling grounds around Cossack.
In 1872, the Australian Fishing Company was floated in London, and these two
yachts were fitted out in England to engage in the industry in North West Australia
(Streeter 1886:160). Ample capital was available. Lieutenant Ross, R.N. (perhaps
one of the family from Melbourne who had been members of the abortive Camden
Harbour Pastoral Association in 1863), was contracted for three years, and twentyeight
crewmen were said to have been specially chosen from the English fishing
fleets (Bain 1982:74). In his prospectus, the promoter estimated that each diver could
bring up 100 shells in an hour, an extreme exaggeration.
The 150-ton Flower of Yarrow, commanded by Lieutenant Ross, called at Fremantle,
en route from London to the North-West, in March 1874. The Flower of Yarrow,
which had formerly belonged to the Royal Yacht Squadron, carried two 21-pounder
Armstrong guns and had on board a steam launch capable of accommodating
twenty-eight passengers (a boon in heavy tidal waters) (Perth Gazette 20/03/1874).
She also carried equipment for conducting pearling operations on an extensive scale,
and was said to have an auxiliary steam engine (Parsons 1974:12).
The Flower of Yarrow sailed north to join the twenty-nine-year-old Enchantress,
which came to the North West via Singapore, where she had called to recruit divers.
The two vessels apparently commenced shelling as far north as Darwin, and
148
gradually worked down the coast toward Camden Sound and King Sound (Inquirer
03/03/1875). They were finding abundant good-quality shell.
Lieutenant Ross would have been made aware by Robert Sholl or others, of the
presence of shell around Brecknock Harbour. Sholl had spent some time there in
1864 after the wreck of the Calliance, and John McCourt had collected a small
quantity of shell there in 1869 with the schooner Argo (Scholl 1869, C.S.O. 697,
fol.146). The Enchantress was filled with shell, and when the news of this success
reached Roebourne, Sholl predicted that most of the larger vessels would leave
Exmouth Gulf to try to link up with Lieutenant Ross' fleet (Scholl 1874, C.S.O.782,
fol.192).
Disaster struck for the Australian Fishing Company when the Enchantress hit a reef
off Champagny Island on 15 August. The vessel managed to reach Brecknock
Harbour, where she became a complete wreck (Parsons 1980). Then, in
confrontations between the crew and the local Aborigines one European crewman,
one Malay crewman and eight Aborigines were killed. Newspaper reports of the time
mention ‘a sanguiny battle with natives, killed and wounded on both sides’ and that
the ship was a complete wreck. The Aboriginal people concerned could have been
the Worora (Silvester 1998)
Lieutenant Ross had the Enchantress broken up to retrieve her copper fastenings
(Inquirer 03/03/1875) but the pearling project was a failure, and the Flower of Yarrow
was sold (Henderson, G & Henderson, K.J. 1988:150).
Site Description
While the wreck has not been positively identified, It seems likely that the
Enchantress was beached at New Island, located in the entrance to Brecknock
Harbour. This area also has a freshwater spring. Several expeditions from the
Western Australian Museum have seen wreck material there. In 1963, Ian Crawford
found heavy brass pipes, pieces of iron, broken china and a part of a compass
(Crawford 1968:79), and in 1978, Scott Sledge found iron deck supports, bricks and
lead piping (Sledge 1979:39).

In 1802 the French sealing schooner L’Enterprise or Le Entreprize (90 tons, Captain Alexander Le Corre) suffered such severe damage in a gale off Cape Leeuwin that it was lucky to survive. It sailed to Sydney for repairs, and subsequently went sealing in Bass Strait where, on 27 October 1802, it was driven by a gale onto rocks off Southern Sister Island near Flinders Island and was wrecked. Captain Le Corre and eight of the crew were drowned. It is possible that a spar or spars, along with at least part of a name board, were either lost in the initial gale which damaged the L’Enterprise, or were carried by the currents and winds from the wreck site in Bass Strait. Perhaps it was a spar from this vessel which was later picked up and used by the crew of the Congress to make a jibboom.
Nothing is known of the loss of a vessel named Enterprise in Flinders Bay. However the log of the whaler Congress makes it quite clear that the captain was of the opinion that some mishap had occurred to a brig of that name.","NO","Unknown","","","","","N","381/77","N","N","","","","","","","","","","Liverpool?","Liverpool","","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., (2012).

"Era","1928/07/16","15 miles S/W Dongara","","","","","N","4.40","","","1033, 33, A 752"," e Era was originally built as an 80-ft racing yacht for Alfred George Milson of North Shore, Sydney, at a cost of £5?000. Its poured lead keel weighed 23 tons. Its racing career lasted only a few years, and for a time it was laid up. A subsequent owner was Nicholas Johnson of Sydney. It was then purchased by Charles Nelson on behalf of Winter, Brandt & Co. of Geraldton, and sailed in full racing trim by Nelson to Fremantle. The voyage took only 21 days, which was considered to be a very fast passage at the time. One of the conditions of the sale was that the Era be taken out of eastern states waters, as Milson could not bear to see it converted into a fishing boat.
In Fremantle the vessel’s large counter stern was cut off, the interior stripped, and a 16?000?lb (7?273 kg) capacity icebox installed. The purchase cost of the Era is said to have been recovered from the sale of its luxury fittings. The ketch was then used as a mother ship to smaller fishing boats at Shark Bay, taking their catch to markets in Geraldton and Fremantle. The vessel retained much of its racing yacht speed after alteration—‘On a trip to [from] Shark Bay, skippered by Ben Green, the Era gave the State Ship Koolinda a start from the Carnarvon jetty and beat her to Geraldton by several hours’ (Cooper, 1996: 96). The 40 hp motor fitted in 1924 was seldom used. This engine only lasted three years, and for the next 23 years Era was worked without an engine. In 1950 a 40 hp Lister motor was installed.
Its great spread of canvas enabled the boat to often cover the distance from Fremantle to Geraldton in 23 hours. On a later voyage it was stated that on:
One trip from Red Bluff to Fremantle, a distance of approximately 600 miles, was completed in 68 hours, and on that occasion several periods of contrary winds were encountered, and occasionally the vessel was becalmed (Burns, 1978).
It should also be noted that this would probably have been with a full load of fish for the Fremantle market, collected from numerous other smaller boats working in the area.
The Era was the cause of considerable concern in October 1934 when a fisherman named Frank Money (also referred to as Mooney) came across what appeared to be a sunken vessel near Leander Reef, 9 miles south of Dongara and 7 miles offshore. Sticking up 3–4.6 m above the surface of the sea were two masts. Money could approach no closer than 100 m to the spars, but knew that the depth of water at that place was 6 m. A party of fishermen lead by George Travia subsequently made an extensive search of the beach for clues to the wreck, but without success. Later the party went to the site in a launch, and found that the ‘wreck’ was actually the mast and bowsprit from the Era. These had been snapped off and swept overboard some six weeks previously during a storm. Amazingly, both spars had then been caught on rocks 6 m underwater in such a way that they remained upright.
THE LOSS
On 16 July 1928 a strong southerly wind caused the Era to break its mooring and drift down Geraldton Harbour until it hit the viaduct. It was badly holed and sank quickly, a contributing factor being its very heavy lead keel.
INITIAL SALVAGE
After several weeks underwater the Era was raised, using drums filled with air. A refit was carried out on the slipway in Geraldton and it was launched back into the fishing fleet. Masts and rigging were replaced at this time. It finally sank on 28 April 1958 in South Passage, Shark Bay, where the lead keel remains.
Most sources state that Era was built in 1887. However Harry Akerstrom in a letter to Kerr states that it was built in 1883. He worked on the vessel a few years before it was finally wrecked in Shark Bay, and says that:
Era…was an 80 foot racing yacht type drawing about 11 ft of water, she had a lead keel, do not know exact tonnage of lead but it was a fair amount, beautiful fishing boat, do not know who she was built for, but do know she was built in 1883, as it was stamped on its rudder stock, a big brass plate holding the tiller. There was no wheels in those days (Kerr, 1988: 228).
If this date is correct, Era was 75 years old at the time it was finally lost. If 1887 is the correct date of building, Era was still an exceptionally old boat in 1958.
The Era as a specialist vessel was one of the forerunners of modern carrier boats, today used extensively in the rock lobster fishing industry along this section of the Western Australian coast.
The Era must have been exceptionally well designed and constructed to have had such a long working life, firstly as a racing yacht and later as a fishing craft. Though badly damaged against the viaduct at Geraldton and remaining underwater for several weeks in the harbour while salvage was organized, the owners obviously considered it valuable enough to warrant the financial outlay of having the boat repaired and put back into service.","NO","Australia","","","","434.00","40 hp fitted 1924","115/80","N","N","","","24.42","","","","","93587 Later fishing boat registration number G 11","Waterview Bay, Sydney, NSW","","","","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

Stewart & Sons, also of Blackwall. The machinery space is stated as 21.21 tons, a large percentage of the gross tonnage, but to be expected in a tug. In 1888 it was owned by the Orient Steam Navigation Company and based at Diego Garcia. Originally registered as No. 1011/1884 in London, the tug was bought by the joint owners Alex Armstrong, senior and junior, and George Waters, all of Albany. It was registered at Fremantle in 1901 (No. 1/1901).
The Escort had departed Albany at 5.30 pm on 13 August 1903 with a cargo of supplies for settlers at Walpole (Marshall, 2001). Another reference states that it was carrying rails from Albany for Flinders Bay (McKenna, 1967). There were eight men on board, including Alex Armstrong, Clem Douglas, W. Nelson and A. Robeson. The tug, sometimes referred to as a launch, was not insured.
THE LOSS
On 15 August the Escort had arrived outside Nornalup Inlet when it was struck by heavy weather. It anchored with two anchors down in continuous rain and heavy squalls near the mouth of the inlet, and during the night two hour watches were maintained by the crew. At midnight the conditions worsened. The ship’s log reads:
Saturday August 16 – At 1 a.m. blowing south east gale, heavy rain squalls, parted port chain. Stood by engines and put man to wheel. At 3 a.m. the starboard chain parted, and took to dodging seas between Rocky point and the reefs, with seas getting heavier and squalls harder. At 10 a.m. wind and sea worse; concluded to put the ship on the beach to save the lives of the crew. 11 a.m. grounded on a sandy bottom, drew fires and opened everything to let her fill. Launch filled standing perfectly upright on even keel. Got on shore with all hands, clothes, sails and stores. Launch made fast with two head lines to the rocks. Made tent with sails and camped the night (quoted in MA 12/92).
Two of the crew, Douglas and Robeson, went for help, leaving the wreck on Monday 18 August and arriving at Denmark at 6.00 pm on the Wednesday after an arduous walk through the bush.
INITIAL SALVAGE
By Tuesday 19 August when the Escort had not returned to Albany as expected, the steam tug The Bruce departed that port to search the coast for the missing vessel. It arrived at Nornalup the following evening. Leaving four of the crew on the wreck The Bruce took two, Armstrong and Nelson, to Albany to collect the necessary equipment to refloat the Escort. However, it was not refloated, but it is apparent that the wreck was stripped.

The wreck lies in Nornalup inlet some 100 m from the bar, on the eastern edge of the inlet. It lies close to rocks, with the steam dome of the boiler visible. Large swells are occasionally met with at this site.
SITE DESCRIPTION
In 1992 a wreck inspection by Dr M. McCarthy of the Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum, noted that the wreck of the Escort lies parallel to the shore, bows pointing southwards, in 2-2.5 m of water on a sandy bottom close to some rocks. The bow and mid-section are canted to port and the forecastle has collapsed, although the deck beams are visible. The most prominent features of the site are the engine and boiler near the middle of the hull. The engine appears to have been torn from its mounting and lies to port and aft of the boiler, whose dome breaks the surface in the swells. The stern has collapsed to starboard, and there is no propeller. Terry Swarbrick, a long-time resident of the district, stated in 1991 that the wreck had undergone very little change over the previous 60 years.","NO","UK","9","1991/07","","2.13","2-cylinder compound steam engine of 20 HP","2009/0111/SG _MA-12/92","Y","Y","-35.031512","","15.12","","116.743804","","","89597","Blackwall, Middlesex","Albany","Fremantle","","Aerial GIS","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

Mitchell & Co., Newcastle, England, in 1869 for John Annan Simpson of Leith. According to Lloyd’s Register it was built under Special Survey and of heavier plate than the rules required. Although it had only one deck it was fitted with two tiers of beams.
At some time it was sold to Jean J. Bordes of Bordeaux, France, and during this ownership it was involved in a stranding in 1895. It was later sold to interests who registered the vessel in British Bermuda. The date of the name change is not known, but in the 1888 Lloyd’s Register it is still called Haidee. At the time of wrecking the vessel, now called Europa, was owned by O.R. Treglia and registered in Castellamaire, Italy.
THE LOSS
The Europa sailed from Glasgow on 11 October 1896. The master, Captain Viponi (Henderson, 1986) or Tommaso di Janni, (Cairns & Henderson, 1995) claimed that as he approached the Western Australian coast his chronometer had malfunctioned. He was therefore unsure of his position and, although out of sight of land, had used his lead to ascertain the depth of water. At about 8.00 to 8.30 on the morning of 10 January 1897 he found a depth of 25–30 fathoms between Sand Knoll Ledge and Escape Bay. The Europa struck a reef about half an hour later. The sea was fairly calm and the weather was hazy.
The Europa filled to the level of the main deck, and it was obvious there was little chance of getting it off. The sails were left all standing. The crew abandoned the vessel at 6.00 p.m. on 11 January and went by boat to the mainland, where they set up a camp under the command of the First Mate. The Master and Second Mate, Alberigo, obtained assistance from nearby Hamersley station to travel to Fremantle to report the wrecking. To prevent salvage claims on an abandoned vessel, the crew were ordered to keep watch and re-board the Europa if any other vessel approached.
It was 16 January before the Master reported to the Italian Consular Agent, Elias Solomon. The SS Eleanor set out with Customs Officer Armstrong and Lloyd’s surveyor, Captain Webster, on board. On arrival at the wreck Webster found that the water was level with the deck on the port side aft, but 1.8 m below the foredeck.
Captain Webster reported that the Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd’s SS Lubra had already started unloading cargo from the wreck. Captain Owen, Adelaide Steamship’s Marine Superintendent, was supervising the discharge of cargo and he formally handed over the wreck to the Customs Officer. Some of the crew of the Europa had come out from the beach, but had been unable to prevent the transfer of cargo. In fact Police Constable Casserly of Gingin, who had been sent to investigate the whereabouts of the crew on the beach, reported that five of the Europa’s crew were helping to discharge the cargo into the Lubra.
INQUIRY
There was no inquiry, as these were only held for foreign owned ships if requested by the diplomatic representative of that country after he had received a Captain’s report on the event.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The Europa was at first considered to be not badly damaged. It was thought that she could be salvaged if lightened by the removal of some or all of the cargo. This consisted of 573 tons of ‘deadweight’ (see glossary) and 995 tons of ‘measurement’ (i.e. by volume). It was mainly bar iron and steel, cases of beer, stout and whiskey, hogsheads of beer, china plates and 130 packages of weighing machines for the government. The value of this cargo was about £11?000.
The Lubra under the supervision of Captain Owen, Adelaide Steamship’s Marine Superintendent, salvaged some 600 tons of cargo (largely cased alcohol) by 17 January and this was taken to Fremantle. Five of the crew of Lubra were left on board to maintain the salvage claim. A week later a further 200–300 tons of cargo (mainly cased liquor, bedding and plate) was salvaged and taken to Fremantle by the Lubra. The crew of the Lubra also removed sails and probably some of the rigging. The steam tug Beagle acting for the underwriters and agents, W. Sandover and Company, made an attempt at salvaging the vessel, but due to rough weather was unable to get along side.
Salvaged cargo was stored in Fremantle by the Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd until satisfactory arrangements could be made with the Europa’s agents. Shortly after the last of the dry cargo was removed, the barque and its remaining cargo were sold to Connor & Doherty for £220. They used the Beagle to continue salvage and removed most of the remainder of the cargo.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck lies 125 km south of Dongara, 7.4 km from Escape Island and 5.6 km from Sand Knoll Ledge and is 4 km from the nearest part of the mainland.
SITE DESCRIPTION
Most of the hull of the Europa lies on top of the reef in 4–6 m of water, but the stern and part of the starboard side has collapsed into reef holes 10–12 m deep. The keel lies in an east-west direction, bow towards the shore. Some of the cargo, mainly bottles and crockery (broken and intact), remains trapped by the collapsed iron decking and is also scattered in the vicinity. Two anchors lie on site, one to the north of the wreck and one to the south.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
The initial wreck inspection by the Western Australian Museum recovered a number of artefacts including 103 intact china plates and bottles, and fragments of bottles, jars and plates. Some brass and copper items including a porthole were also recovered. No formal excavation has been carried out on the wreck. In 1986 approval was given for an anchor to be raised for exhibition in the town of Cervantes. The anchor was raised by the Museum with the assistance of local people including Bill McLay, the finder of the wreck. The Dandaragan Shire then conserved and mounted the anchor under the Museum’s guidance.","NO","UK","15","36226","","5.80","N","2009/0112/SG _MA-379/77","Y","Y","-30.4027166667","","57.10","","114.9859","","","62283","Newcastle-on-Tyne","Glasgow","Castellamaire, Italy","Fremantle","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

It was a cutter with an oval stern and was initially owned by William Edward Marmion, merchant of Fremantle. He sold it to Richmond Burton, lighterman of Geraldton, on 21 April 1890. Only a couple of weeks later the Evelyn Mary went ashore on Long Island in the Abrolhos Islands, on a voyage from Fremantle to Geraldton with Burton in command. This occurred during a violent storm in which the schooner Planet was wrecked at Port Irwin, and the Electra damaged. The Evelyn Mary was subsequently refloated.
THE LOSS
The Evelyn Mary was to take a cargo of fresh water from Geraldton to the Abrolhos Islands. Halfway across the Geelvink Channel heavy seas were encountered, kicked up by a strong southerly wind. The skipper, a man known as ‘Duchy’, decided to put the vessel about and make back to port. However the cutter was driven off course, and finished up 16 km north of Geraldton near the mouth of the Oakajee River. As the boat was leaking badly, the anchor was dropped to enable the crew to man the pumps. Unfortunately the cable parted, so a decision was made to make sail and beach the boat. It was run into what appeared to the crew to be a safe place, but the cutter subsequently broke up in the heavy surf.","NO","WA","","","","1.60","N","117/80","N","N","","","13.00","","","","","61113","Fremantle","Geraldton","Fremantle","Abrolhos","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

THE VESSEL
The Experience was built at Fremantle by Alfred Edmund Brown, and registered as number 47 of 1904. The owners at various times were Joseph John Eacott, Robison and Norman Ltd, Abraham Davies, Mark Rubin, Richard Richards, Mary Jane Tripp, William James Squire, Walter Clarke-Hall (owner in 1923), Alice Mary Edgar, Una May Clarke-Hall, Isobel Margaret Kennedy, Herbert Kennedy and the Commonwealth Government. The vessel was rebuilt in 1936, when it was also fitted with a 14 hp Heinke diesel engine. The registration had been allowed to lapse and it was not re-registered until 1941 as number 1 of 1941.
THE LOSS
During February 1942 the Royal Australian Navy requisitioned all the luggers in the north of Western Australia under Regulation 57 of the National Security (General) Regulations of the National Security Act 1939–1940, to prevent them possibly falling into the hands of the Japanese. This action was supposed to be temporary, but many requisitioned luggers were later purchased by the Commonwealth Government. Some 29 of the least seaworthy were destroyed, and, apart from two used by the army the remainder were sailed towards the south by naval personnel, leaving Broome around mid-March. On 25 March 1942 a cyclone struck that part of the fleet that had reached Port Hedland. Of the 21 vessels in port 15 were sunk, although ten were subsequently salvaged. Other losses occurred in Geraldton Harbour (see: 6 Requisitioned Luggers 1942).
Further south more luggers were wrecked around the end of June. The Bronlan is reported to have been wrecked north of Jurien Bay and the Experience wrecked either south of Jurien Bay (Lance, 2004) or at Scarborough (Dickson, 1996 & Straczek, 1996).
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
The requisitioning of small vessels is an important but little known event in the history of Western Australia during World War II. There are few references to the 44 luggers which the Royal Australian Navy tried to save by sailing them south from Broome in 1942.

THE VESSEL
Nothing is known regarding the origins and specifications of this vessel. It was first mentioned by Edward John Eyre during his expedition from Fowlers Bay in South Australia to Albany. On 29 March 1841 Eyre wrote in his journal:
For the last two or three days, we had passed many pieces of wreck upon the beach, oars, thwarts of boats, fragments of masts, spars, &c. strewed about in every direction: none of them, however, appeared to have been recently deposited there, and many of the oars, and lighter spars, were stuck up on their ends in the sand above high water mark, probably so placed by the natives, but with what object I know not. One oar was stuck up upon a high sand ridge, some distance from the shore, and I spent some time examining the place, in the vain hope that it might be an indication of our vicinity to water (Eyre, 2007).
Eyre gives no indication of the type of vessel or where it may have come from. At this time he was at approximately 126º 30’ east longitude. This is a little west of Scorpion Bight. His statement regarding the oars and spars being placed upright by the Aborigines is open to debate. They would more likely have been placed by the crew of the wrecked ship in order to attract the attention of passing vessels. There were many whaling ships sailing along the south coast during the late 1830s and early 1840s.
In 1976 John Carlisle reported the finding of material from a wreck 55 kilometres east of Eyre. This places it very close to Scorpion Bight. Mr Carlisle, who had been in that area since 1928, related a story told to him by the Aborigines regarding the wreck of a ship prior to Eyre’s expedition through their territory. A ship had been seen approaching the coast giving off smoke. A boat brought five people ashore where some lay down while others walked around. The following morning two of the men lay dead and others had dug holes in the sand. The ship drifted in to the shallow water, rolling over on to its side a little later. Within eight days another man died, and the Aborigines killed a fourth by spearing him. However, the fifth man was not killed as he had blond hair. Presumably kept by the tribe as a curio for some time, the survivor eventually went with the Aboriginal tribe who lived to the east of his captors. The Aborigines known to Mr Carlisle took him to the spot where the boat was supposed to have come ashore with the survivors. Here he found several small brass or copper nails, and about 500 m east he found the main wreckage.
This story is echoed by a similar Aboriginal legend related by W. Graham, the Eyre’s Sandpatch Telegraph Station manager during the 1930s. The story relates that before Eyre made his journey, a two-masted vessel had been wrecked about 20 miles east of the station. Five men had come ashore in a boat and attempted to contact the Aborigines. This had been unsuccessful, as had their search for water. After collecting some of the berries (noria in the Aboriginal language) growing there they left. The following morning the wreck had disappeared.
In 1859 William Jackman published his autobiography The Australian Captive. In it he claims that he sailed from Hobart on board the whaler Carib of Brixom [sic], England, and that on 28 April 1837 the ship was wrecked on the south coast nearly equidistant between Adelaide and King George Sound. This places it in the vicinity of Scorpion Bight. The vessel was commanded by Captain Thompson. Five of the crew were lost in the wreck, and Jackman became separated from the others. He then lived for some 18 months with the Aborigines in that area. The story has some aspects that are credible, and are supported to an extent by other evidence, such as the history related by the Aborigines. Jackman’s autobiography includes many verifiable facts and information that indicates he must have been in that area at some time. However, it appears that there was no vessel named Carib which departed from Hobart around that period (Henderson, 2007: 205). There was a brigantine named Carib, and it is listed in Lloyd’s between 1836 and 1839, but with no indication that it ever came to Australia (ibid.).
Jackman states that he was subsequently rescued by the Hobart owned whaler Camilla and, after continuing whaling for some months, the ship landed him at Albany on 27 June 1839. The Camilla was certainly whaling in the area during that time, having carried out eight voyages between 1838 and 1844. Jackman later walked to Two People Bay to join the Avis, an American whaler out of New London. This was wrecked in the bay during a gale (see entry); two other whalers, Harvest and Peruvian, both also at anchor, were undamaged. Both these vessels are recorded as being in the area at the time that the Avis was wrecked, having anchored at Albany in May 1842. Several days after the wreck of the Avis, Jackman signed on to the Elizabeth of New Bedford (Captain Esthman), also known to have been in the area at that time. He therefore has many facts to back his claim of shipwreck and survival. Some of his dates are incorrect, but the book was written some 17 years or more after the events so these are understandable. What is not proven is that a whaler named Carib was wrecked in April 1837.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck lies on the coast approximately 46 km south and 16 km west of Madura Roadhouse. In 1976 a wreck inspection by Scott Sledge of the Western Australian Museum located some wreckage at the low water mark in longitude 126º 51’ east, which led him to believe a nineteenth century whaler or sealer had been wrecked there some time during the early part of that century. The size of some iron deck knees indicated a vessel of about 400 tons. In 1989 Graeme Henderson led another Museum wreck inspection which reached the beach south of Madura and then travelled west along the coast. After travelling about 10 km the party found substantial wreckage, more being found at various places over the next eight kilometres.
SITE DESCRIPTION
Several iron knees lie in the intertidal zone, with at about two dozen iron hull fastenings distributed in 2 m of water  just south-west of these. One knee measured 1.1 m along the horizontal leg and 1.6 m along the vertical. Another was measured to have a length of 1.8 m. All this material was heavily concreted. A 10 m length of the port side of a timber vessel with chain plates was found buried on the beach, and subsequently excavated. Other smaller timbers were located, some with treenails in place.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
Some of the concreted hull fastenings were taken to the Western Australian Museum where one was broken open, revealing 85% corrosion.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
It is presumed that the wreckage examined by Museum staff is that recorded by Eyre in 1841, and is therefore historically linked with that famous explorer.
SOCIAL (3)
The story given by Jackman raises several questions. Part of it may relate to the loss of the vessel, remains of which were seen by Eyre. Unfortunately, it is not clear what part of his story is fact, or the correct name of the vessel involved.

"Fairy","1849/06/12","Princess Royal Harbour, Albany","Captain Thomas Symers","Symers and Dunn","","ship was never completed but allowed to rot","Y","","","No cargo","AUS 109"," Fairy is a vessel about which there is much confusion. Because it was never registered, this confusion is likely to continue. It was built either by Captain Thomas Symers (Garden, 1977: 101 and Dickson, 1999: 266) or for Captain Symers (Henderson 2007: 301 and Marshall, 2001: 155). What is not in dispute is the location of building on the banks of the Kalgan River, about a mile upstream from the mouth. If the Henderson/Marshall information is correct, the builders would have been Solomon Cook, Mr Metcalf and Mr Covert (Captain James Sale, quoted in Marshal, 2001: 155). Building using local jarrah commenced in 1844, but was very slow due to financial problems faced by Symers, so on 17 December 1849 he took two partners into the project, John Thomas and James Dunn.
There is further confusion over the rig. While Captain Sale stated that the vessel was to have been rigged as a brig (Marshall, 2001: 155), others state that it was rigged as a schooner (Dickson, 1998: 266 and Henderson, 2007: 301). In a letter from Symers to his agent in Perth declining the offer of buying a block of land that he badly wanted, he stated:
I am sorry to say that I cannot purchase land at present, the whole of my ready money being on the schooner - £750 worth and still wanting sails and an anchor and cable to complete her (Glover, 1953: 87).
While Dunn contributed finance, it may be presumed that Captain Symers intended to command the vessel himself. At the time of its loss the Fairy was moored in Princess Royal Harbour, having been brought from Oyster Harbour on 13 June 1850 by Dunn.
THE LOSS
A disagreement arose over ownership and payment for the work needed to complete the fitting out of the Fairy. In October 1850 James Dunn sent a petition to the Governor requesting arbitration. The Governor declined to become involved, describing the dispute as a commercial matter. The dispute appears to have remained unresolved, leading to the abandonment and subsequent loss of the vessel. There are a number of differing versions as to the exact sequence of events that led up to this loss:
1. The mooring rope was cut, allowing the vessel to drift onto a sand bank where its back was broken (Stan Austen, quoted in Marshall, 2001: 154).
2. The vessel was left as a derelict and broke its mooring and washed ashore (Howard Hartmann, quoted in Henderson, 2007: 302).
3. The vessel just rotted away at its mooring (Dickson, 1998: 266 and Captain Sale, quoted in Marshall, 2001: 155).
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Fairy lies almost on the 2-metre contour towards the western end of Princess Royal Harbour, directly south of the old wool stores.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck of the Fairy lies on a north-west/south-east axis, possibly with the stern to the south-east. A keel (16.75 m long and canted about 45º to the north-east) and six floors are visible, together with a timber which is most probably a stern post. Scattered timbers including a knee, fashion piece and pulley sheave lie close to this, as does a ballast mound 11.2 m long and 2.7 m in width. The site is covered in sea grass and shifting sand patches.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
A wreck inspection in 1991 by Dr Michael McCarthy and Patrick Baker, Maritime Archaeology Department, Western Australian Museum, recovered a double pulley sheave with iron bearings. During a further wreck inspection conducted by McCarthy the following year a sample of timber was taken which on analysis proved to be jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata).
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
SOCIAL (3)
Captain Thomas Lyell Seymour-Symers’ (he later dropped the hyphen) had served with the Honourable East India Company, and arrived in Albany on 1 June 1835.
The Fairy was the third vessel owned by Symers. His first was the 189-ton barque Caledonia, built in Coringa, India. The second was a 50-ton schooner which he commenced building on the Kalgan River in 1835 (Glover, 1953: 75).
The stern post of the wreck of the Fairy projected above water level for many years and was a favourite fishing spot, referred to as ‘Rudder Head’ or ‘Fairy Spit’.
Fairy (1844-1850)
Construction of the Fairy commenced in 1844. Contractors Solomon Cook, Mr Metcalf and Mr Covert built it on the bank of the Kalgan River for Captain Symers. Unfortunately the vessel’s construction dragged on until the end of the 1840s, delayed by Symers’ financial difficulties, and a dispute over the rigging of the vessel between Symers and one of his new business partners, James Dunn. During the dispute work stopped and the vessel sat unused in Princess Royal Harbour. In 1850 the Fairy was blown from its moorings onto a shallow sandbank (another report says that its mooring rope was cut) where the wreck remains to this day. An archaeological survey by the WA Museum in 1991 located hull timbers, ballast and a pulley sheave indicating it was likely to have been rigged at the time of its wrecking. The Fairy has been described as both a schooner and a brig, of between 100-150 tons.
Alhough it never left Albany, the wreck of the Fairy is significant as one of Western Australia’s earliest examples of local shipbuilding, and warrants further study.","NO","WA","","1991/07","","","N","2009/0114/SG _MA-9/92","Y","Y","-35.0385","","","","117.8606666667","","","","Albany, Kalgan River","","","","GPS","Protected State","Worsley P. & J.

"Fairy Queen","1875/10/08","Exmouth N W Cape","","Messrs Marmion, Brown and Gill","Captain Andrew Edgar","Struck land","Y","","","Shell (Pearling)","AUS 744","ex Rhio.
The  115-ton wooden-hulled  two-masted Dutch vessel Rhio was built in Singapore at an unknown date  and after being sold to Swan River Colony identities Messrs W.E Marmion, (Aubrey) Brown and Gill in the July of 1875  sailed from there  on 3 August 1875 for the north-west pearl fishery.   There were 37  divers  and crew onboard   and one stowaway. One diver was named ‘Sahber’ and another was called ‘Allie’. He was from Muscat and had been engaged by Marmion at Singapore. The pastoralist and pearler William Marmion was the managing owner and the master was Andrew Edgar. Few details of  Fairy Queen survive,  and though it  appears also described as a ‘schooner’  by Edgar  describes it  as being ‘brigantine-rigged’ .
While in the  ‘China Sea’ they  were beset by a heavy squall  and sustained  damage to the fore topmast and this was repaired. In transiting the Sunda Strait under reduced sail  in early September  another  storm hit and  the tiller and rudder head were  damaged and a jury rig was fabricated in order to keep the schooner on course. In the traverse south across the Indian Ocean in the SE Trade winds they again suffered  damage  to the rigging and in gales nearer the coast in c. 25-26° S they were beset with  strong south westerly winds forcing them to head west during the night and lie ‘snug’  till dawn. Though they had travelled as far south as Cape Cuvier, by 7 October the conditions forced Edgar to abandon his attempt to make Shark Bay  and  to seek shelter in Exmouth Gulf.   
After   running northwards all night  they sighted Point Cloates bearing ESE ‘about 18 miles’  and continued north.  At 6PM Edgar went up on the foreyard to keep watch  and by 6.45 visibility was so bad he  could  ‘scarcely see the land’ forcing him to take a star sight to ascertain his position. 
I came down from the foreyard and took a meridian altitude of the star Aquila- I found it gave me  21 °49” the latitude of the Cape being 21°47”.
At around 9PM on 7 October the reef at North West Cape was seen abeam and they  rounded  the Cape and with the  land still  barely visible Edgar looked for shelter in its lee. Finding the  seas too rough  to anchor they proceeded  into the Gulf under reduced sail in order to ride out the night. At midnight deducing he was somewhere nearby  Y Island Edgar headed back west on a port tack again under reduced sail.  Confident  they were still well out in the gulf he went below at 3AM on to rest. Before doing so he issued orders for soundings to be taken continuously and for him to be called back on deck  before the hour was up so they could ‘wear ship’ with the land still  ‘a good way off’. As instructed he was recalled to the deck by the mate at 3.45 AM and after  taking the helm and with the schooner still coming into the wind Edgar felt  that there was a malfunction with the jury tiller. He describes that he had  felt it  ‘knock about my legs and realising  something had gone wrong with the wheel, ‘put my hand on the Barrel’ and on feeling  around in the dark he  realised the wheel ropes had slipped off rendering the Brigantine again rudderless.  Edgar then describes  the events that followed. 
Before I could get things right the mate sung out  Breakers ahead. I sung out let go the anchor and before it would hold she struck heavy on the starboard bilge  . . .  at around 4AM the vessel washed up on to the beach the sea breaking over her’. 
Edgar was not sure whether they were  on a sandbank or on the shore and to make matters worse,  deck  planks began to open up as  the dawn broke. Realising that they were shorebound on an ebbing tide, the crew set about  lightening  the ship by taking everything they could  ashore. The  divers also  ‘carried the starboard anchor out underwater’  and hove on the cable in order to keep the wreck from driving further up the beach. The port anchor which had been earlier let go   was retrieved and connected with a ‘new 5-inch hawser’ was carried out  over the stern into deeper water by boat in readiness for an attempt to refloat the ship  at high tide.
It was all to no avail as the rising tide revealed that the hull planks had also opened up,  that some of the copper sheathing had fallen off and  that the ship had began to sink in the sand with its port gunwhale underwater. Over the next two days they  ‘stripped the ship and got everything above high water mark’.   There they found that their fresh water casks had been contaminated by the sea and they had only one cask left from which to drink.   With this and the fact that the vessel was clearly breaking up  in mind,  all thought of a successful refloating  evaporated. Soon after midday on 12 October  they abandoned the Brigantine  and the equipment in the beach and set off  in the 5 boats for Tien Tsin ( also referred to as Port Walcott and Cossack).   They all succeeded in reaching the  Mary Anne Patch two  days later, but not without considerable difficulty and one capsize.  Edgar and some of the crew were  then taken by  the cutter Swan to Cossack arriving on 18 October where Edgar provided  the details recorded above in a letter to the sub collector of Customs  that he penned the following day. Fairy Queen  and the equipment ashore was  sold at an  auction held at Cossack  on 21 October  for what was then described as a  ‘trifle’, the successful bidders apparently   acting on behalf of the owners. 
On 8 November a formal court of Inquiry was held before Resident Magistrate R.J. Sholl, (who was also the sub-collector of customs), a JP assisting and a ‘Nautical Assessor’, A.E. Merrale, the commander of the  pearling schooner Flower of Yarrow which was then in port.  On hearing the evidence, which provides further detail to Edgar’s letter above,  the court  deliberated and produced the following verdict
We find that the  weather at the time was squally with strong puffs of wind and that the night was very dark. We also find that previously the steering gear had been carried away and temporarily repaired, and that it was carried away again when the “Fairy Queen” was  close to the reef, rendering her unmanageable at the time. We find that the position of the Fairy Queen at the time was wholly due to an insufficient knowledge of  the tides and currents on the part of Capt. Edgar, but in the ‘absence of  reliable directions  and charts  we cannot recommend the suspension of either Captain Edgar or the Mate.  
The Cutter Albert is known to have been despatched to recover the goods on the beach, and that the  salvage  of whatever remained at the site thereafter  would have been extensive  over the years, especially given the number of pearlers that frequented Exmouth Gulf through to the mid 1880s. Other than a note about Albert,  little  else appears about the wreck other than in a reference to Capt Tuckey  recovering the two survivors from the wreck of the Stefano at a place close to the then still visible wreck of the Fairy Queen.
Further though it lay ashore and in the lee of the Cape, the easterlies there can be very strong, often whipping up quite high seas. These and the effect of cyclones, such as that which beset the Stefano and others since, when combined with salvage of the timbers for firewood and repairs to passing ships,  the effect of teredo worms would have quickly reduced the wreck to the waterline and then down to the sand level and it was soon lost to living memory.  It also appears that the area is prone to cyclic covering and uncovering with sand.

"Fanny Nicholson","1872/11/22","Frenchman’s Bay, King George Sound","","William H. Andrews, of Sydney","Captain Gaffin","","Y","7.77","","Oil","AUS 109","  Fanny Nicholson was built under special survey in Hartlepool, County Durham, with one deck, a poop deck, an elliptical stern and a woman figurehead. The vessel was copper fastened, and sheathed with felt and yellow metal. Damage repairs were made to the barque in 1856 and 1861. It had initially sailed from Liverpool on the South American run, but was brought to Australia in the 1860s. By 1871 it was owned by Captain John McArthur of Hobart and William Andrews, and was being used for whaling out of Hobart. At the conclusion of its first voyage as a whaler out of Hobart the Fanny Nicholson returned with 53 tuns of sperm oil on board. On that voyage it had lost a man and a boat when a whale crushed the boat in its jaws.
The Fanny Nicholson sailed from Hobart on 20 April 1872 under the command of Captain W. Gaffin with a crew of about 25, to hunt for whales along the south coast of Australia, and by November was in the Albany area. Various contemporary newspaper reports have the amount of whale oil on board as being 52, 54, 60 or 70 tuns. The vessel and cargo were only partly insured.
THE LOSS
On Thursday 21 November 1872 the crew of the Fanny Nicholson struck a whale out at sea and, after tying it alongside, entered Frenchman Bay. They anchored with two anchors down prior to cutting and trying the whale. The following night a heavy gale arose from the south-east and the barque parted both anchor cables and ‘ship and whale went ashore’ (Perth Gazette, 29 November 1872: 3e). All the crew got ashore safely.
INITIAL SALVAGE
On 21 December 1872 Captain McArthur, part owner of the wrecked whaler, advertised in a Hobart newspaper for a vessel he could charter to sail to Albany to bring back to Hobart whale oil and gear salvaged from the wreck of the Fanny Nicholson, along with its crew. The barque Free Trader (206 tons, Captain Robinson) was given the charter, and departed Hobart on 27 December 1872 for Albany via Adelaide. Captain Robinson wanted to call at Adelaide as he had a cargo of timber to be offloaded at that port. Captain McArthur boarded the R.M.S. Bangalore at Hobart to travel to Albany to ‘look after the interests of all concerned in the wrecked whaling barque Fanny Nicholson (Mercury, 7 January 1873: 2f). Having loaded the salvaged material and the stranded crew (as well as Captain McArthur), the Free Trader left Albany on 2 February 1873 and, after experiencing adverse winds, arrived back in Hobart on 3 March. Included in the cargo were 52 tuns of salvaged whale oil.
At an auction held at the New Wharf in Hobart on 12 March 1873 the following items from the wreck of the Fanny Nicholson were offered for sale:
Five whaleboats, oil casks, chronometer, telescope, field glass, three casks ship’s bread, five hogsheads and casks flour, four casks sugar, six casks beef, boat compasses, standing and running rigging, wire rigging, wheel, tiller, cutting-in blocks, double and single blocks, oars and steer oars, cutting-in spades, harpoons, lances, masthead gear complete, fluke chains, small chain, kedge anchor, caboose and fittings, coolers, tubs, harness cask, buckets, whale lines, line tubs, tool chest, muskets, ship’s bell, boat masts and sprits, binnacle and compass, ship’s light-house, fishing lines, spun yarn, cabin fittings, gratings, iron work and sundry gear.
The whole of the sails belonging to the ship, pea jackets, jumpers, blue serge shirts, striped shirts, woollen drawers, worsted stockings, mole trousers, blankets, comforters, men’s boots, &c.
Terms – Under £50, Cash, above that sum approved bills at three months (Mercury, 7 March 1873: 4).
(One wonders what other ‘sundry gear’ and ‘&c’ could possibly have been.)
The same newspaper praised the casks used on board the Fanny Nicholson for the storage of whale oil:
Tasmanian Casks. – We had yesterday an opportunity of inspecting the casks containing sperm oil, which have been landed on the New Wharf from the barque Free Trader, which recently returned from King George’s Sound with the oil and other material recovered from the wreck of the whaling barque Fanny Nicholson. Notwithstanding the length of time which the casks were in the wrecked barque before her loss, and the fact that they were afterwards subject to fully two months’ exposure on the sandy beach of King George’s Sound, in the heat of the summer months, they are in all respects as good and tight as when they first left the cooper’s hands. This speaks well for the workmanship of Tasmanian coopers, and affords a satisfactory proof of the durability of Tasmanian timber, its capability to withstand exposure, and its adaptability for works where durability is an essential requisite.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Fanny Nicholson lies in the intertidal zone on Goode Beach. The position of the wreck was plotted by Staff Commander N.E. Archdeacon, and is marked on his chart of Princess Royal Harbour dated 1877.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck lies parallel to the beach, and is almost always covered in sand and rarely visible. Occasionally the sand shifts enough for the upper part of the wreck to be seen in 1-2 m of water very close to the shore. H.L. Hartman writing in 1975 stated that some 50 years previously an exceptionally low tide combined with considerable scouring away of sand had uncovered a large amount of the hull. He saw a stern post sticking up about 6 feet (1.8 m) which he described as being of steel. He later referred to this ‘steel wreck’ to distinguish it from the nearby wooden wreck of the whaler Runnymede (see entry). Over the years this reference has led to claims of there being both a steel or iron wreck and a timber one at Goode Beach. As noted above, the Fanny Nicholson was composite built, i.e. with an iron keel, stem post, stern post and frames but planked with wood.

 Built in Bunbury by Benjamin Jackson for John Morgan, a licensed victualler, and was intended for the coastal trade. It had one deck, a square stern and a scroll head. The vessel was sold to John Bateman on 20 February 1857. The Favourite was the first vessel to be registered under the British Shipping Act in Western Australia, No. 1 in 1856. There is confusion amongst researchers regarding some of the data relating to this vessel. While Dickson gives a date of building as 1855, Henderson and Totty give a date of 1856. As it was launched on 10 February 1856 the majority of the construction would have taken place in 1855, and the registration in early 1856.
Despite the sometimes conflicting data, it is obvious from the context that authors are reporting on the same vessel.
The Favourite had twice gone ashore before the final wrecking. In September 1856 it was stranded at Bunbury, but quickly refloated. On 15 January 1858 it struck a reef at the Abrolhos Islands, causing considerable damage. At this time it was owned by John Bateman who managed to have it refloated and repaired. The vessel continued to trade along the coast, often carrying guano from the Abrolhos Islands to Bunbury.
THE LOSS
While sailing out of Port Gregory through Hero Passage (Totty, 1979) or Gold Digger Passage (Henderson, 1988) the Favourite struck the reef where it quickly started to break up.
SITE LOCATION
Possibly on the outer tip of the reef forming the northern side of Hero Passage.
SITE DESCRIPTION
If the above location is correct, wreckage that has been found scattered among the rocks and reefs near Hero Passage is probably from the Favourite.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
A number of artefacts have been sighted or recovered which are believed to have come from the Favourite. These include rudder gudgeons, timber and two old bottles with original contents still inside. The gudgeons are of the size with which Favourite would have been fitted, and while they, the timber and the bottles are not positive identification, it seems likely that the items came from the Favourite.","NO","WA","7","","","2.30","N","56/72","N","N","","","20.30","","","","","40468","Bunbury","Bunbury","Fremantle","","","Protected Federal","IWorsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

THE VESSEL
In 1862 the P&O Company at Albany received four iron lighters, each of 140 tons, 76 feet long (23.2 m) with a beam of 18 feet (5.5 m). These arrived in sections and were assembled on the foreshore, the first being launched in early May 1863 and the last in April the following year. The company’s agent at Albany, William Carmalt Clifton, recommended the construction of either a patent slip or a floating dock so that the lighters and the company’s hulk Kingfisher could be cleaned and repaired when necessary. The small tidal range in Princess Royal Harbour made a slip impractical, so a decision was made to build a floating dock. Plans were drawn by Captain Charles Louis van Zuilecom, previously in command of the Hindoo, who also supervised the construction. On 14 April 1864 tenders were called for the supply of suitable timber, and building commenced in July.
Constructed mainly of jarrah (an estimated 100 tons) with iron fastenings, the dock was strongly built with a double bottom. It was enclosed on two sides and one end, and at the other end were gates that could be made water tight. Three valves, opened and shut by operating rods from the deck which ran around two sides and the enclosed end, were fitted to each side to enable water to be let in. This was let in until the dock sank. The vessel to be serviced was floated in and shored up, the gates were then closed and sealed and the water pumped out. Initially the pumping was done manually, but this was later replaced by a windmill, and then by a centrifugal steam pump. The steam for this pump was provided through a flexible copper hose either by the vessel being docked, or by a steam tender moored alongside. However, the windmill was retained to keep the dock dry when it was not being used, as the gates were not completely water tight.
The dock was constructed by Mr Daniels (P&O’s shipwright) broadside to the sea, and successfully launched that way on 14 April 1866 (much to the surprise of sceptics in the watching crowd).
When the P&O Company ceased operations in Albany the floating dock was taken over by Armstrong and Waters, and used for local vessels. Although originally guaranteed to last four years, the dock was still being used forty years later when it was used to dock a vessel of 130 tons during April 1906.
THE LOSS
Although still afloat at least until 1910, the dock had become worm eaten and began to leak badly. However, with no other dock available in which it could be repaired, during WW I it eventually sank. To prevent the dock being a hindrance to shipping, explosives were used to blow the sides and end so that the remains lay flat on the sea bed.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The pump was removed at an unknown date, and that gear which was easily salvaged after it sank was collected before the sunken dock was dynamited.
SITE LOCATION
The dock sank 100 m from the Town Jetty, towards and level with the Coal Jetty. The bottom and keel survived, and were visible up until the 1940s. There appears to have been no attempts made to remove the remains, which were subsequently buried under port developments during the 1950s.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
ARCHAEOLOGICAL (4)
The buried remains of the floating dock have the potential to provide information on the construction of this rare vessel.
RARE (7)
This floating dock is the oldest of only three known wooden floating docks built in Australia. Only one is still in existence, at Mannum in South Australia. Launched in September 1873 to service the Murray River paddle steamers it proved unsuccessful and was later set into the bank of the Murray River for use as a berth for paddle steamers. The other was a barque converted at Melbourne in 1894-95 as a floating dock, and in the early 1960s burnt on the shore at Hobson Bay.

"Flying Foam","1872/03/10","Abrolhos Area","William Jackson of Fremantle","John Bateman of Fremantle","","Cyclone","N","4.80","","","","Flying Foam was a two-masted schooner with one deck and square stern built at South Beach, Fremantle, by William Jackson. The joint owners were John and Walter Bateman, merchants of Fremantle. The Batemans employed Jackson as a shipwright after he came to Western Australia. He had previously worked as a shipwright for the Royal Navy. At the launching the design of Flying Foam was praised, together with the high standard of cabin accommodation.
THE LOSS
Flying Foam under Captain Charles Reeves with crew and three passengers left Champion Bay on 7 March 1872, and was seen by the schooner May (Captain Vincent) about 11 km west of Geraldton and heading for Fremantle. There is some confusion regarding the passengers who lost their lives in this tragedy. The Inquirer and Commercial News gives them as being Mr Arthur Patten, his wife and child. Further research however seems to indicate that the family involved was that of Walter Hicks Patten. He had previously been in the Police Force stationed at Greenough. The Bicentennial Dictionary of Western Australians 1829–1888 states that Walter Patten, his wife and child, were lost at sea in March 1872. A severe storm with winds from the north-west (referred to as a cyclone in the shipping register) struck on 10 March. The Flying Foam was not seen again. Prior to this voyage, it had damaged its stern when it hit the Fremantle jetty, and the damage had only been patched over with canvas. It seems likely that this inadequate repair was a major factor contributing to the loss of the vessel.
INQUIRY
Geraldton residents chartered the brigantine Clarence Packet to search the Abrolhos Islands for the missing Flying Foam. Authorities in Dongara obtained the use of the cutter Arabian to also search the Abrolhos Islands and the mainland. Two whale-boats from Fremantle were sent to search the coast northwards from that port, one under the command of Captain Charles Gabriel Hanham and the other skippered by John Tapper. No trace was found of the vessel and no bodies were recovered.","NO","WA","","","All","2.10","N","","N","N","","","18.30","","","","","36544","Fremantle","Champion Bay","Fremantle","Fremantle","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

A boat belonging to Mr. G. King, named the Flying Scud, left Butcher's Inlet with a crew consisting of G. King, J. Carroll, and a native lad. When they got to a reef between Point Samson and Cape Lambert, through which there is a shoal passage, the boat got upon the rocks. The crew remained by her for some time, but as they could not get her off, left her and made for the shore. The native arrived without much exertion, but poor King, who was ill at the time, was drowned; Carroll saved himself with difficulty. The native went to the Lower Landing and spread the alarm. Mr.
W. C Paterson, Mr. Best, and others immediately started to render assistance to Carroll, who was much exhausted, but they missed him, and found him at Mr. Best’s house on their return. Here he was treated with great kindness. The
next morning Mr. Paterson's boat was sent to the spot with Mr. Best and others to search for King's body. They were not successful. The boat was found to be a total wreck. A search was afterwards made along shore by p c. Vin
cent, but no body was found. It is thought it must have been devoured by sharks. The coast was strewed with wreck.

The engine was covered, but the boat itself was open.
THE LOSS
According to Les Douglas of Albany, the Fram was abandoned by the Norwegians when the whaling station closed. It and the Elvie were subsequently washed ashore in the same storm, and probably came to rest in roughly the same area.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The engine and propeller were, in all probability, salvaged as the Fram lay on the shore. The wreck is believed to have fairly quickly broken up.","NO","","","","","","Single cylinder crude oil engine","","N","N","","","12.19","","","","","","","","","","","Unknown","Worsley P. & J.

Ltd.","Thomas West","Always visible","Y","8.02","330.00","General","AUS 84, Adm 1059","Franklin was built in Glasgow by D. and W. Henderson and Company for the Spencer’s Gulf Steamship Company, later to amalgamate with The Adelaide Steamship Company in December 1882. Launched in August of 1880, the vessel had one deck, an awning deck, seven bulkheads and was cemented. Although the 1887-88 edition of Lloyd’s Register states the power of the engine as 162 hp, other references report it as 280 hp. The Franklin may have been re-engined at some time during its working life. In July 1893 the Franklin struck an anchor in Townsville Harbour. The anchor pierced the ship’s bottom causing it to sink, but it was later raised and repaired. The ship had been thoroughly overhauled and fitted with a new boiler at Mort’s Dock, Sydney, only about twelve months before its loss at Point Malcolm.
Under the command of Captain Thomas West with a crew of 20, including John Syvert, first mate and Robert Innes, second mate, the ship departed Albany at 10.30 pm on 15 April for Israelite Bay via various small ports. On board was 20 tons of cargo and seven passengers – Mr and Mrs A. Byrne, Mr and Mrs W. Baird and infant, Mrs Smith and Mrs Walkington. These passengers must have disembarked at Esperance, as by the time the Franklin called at Point Malcolm, the only two passengers on board were Smith and Hackett, telegraph operators on their way to Israelite Bay.
The Franklin’s draught was stated as 11 ft (3.35 m) forward and 11 ft 6 inches (3.5 m) aft. The ship was valued at £10 000, and the cargo on this voyage at £500.
THE LOSS
At 5.00 p.m. on Friday 18 April 1902, the Franklin was heading slowly towards its normal anchorage at Point Malcolm when it lightly struck something. Although the contact was felt by those on board little notice was taken and the ship dropped anchor, 30 fathoms (55 m) of cable being let go, just as the chief engineer, Alexander Brodie, emerged from the engine room and announced that the ship was flooding. He reported that the water had put out the fire in the middle boiler, and then returned immediately to the engine room to draw the fires on the two outside boilers and open the valves so as to prevent an explosion. To do this he had to work in water up to his neck. The ship quickly sank onto a rocky bottom in 14 feet (4.27 m) of water, having filled in just ten minutes. It was initially considered that the ship would be salvageable if the weather remained fair, but it was in a dangerous position in the event of rough weather.
INQUIRY
There were thought to be no projecting rocks in the area, and initial reports at the time indicated that the Franklin most probably struck an old anchor, possibly one abandoned by an early whaler, ‘a number of which are scattered along the coast’ (Albany Advertiser, 22 April 1902: 3g). This, it was surmised, started one or two of the hull plates. Clarrie Andrews, a crewman off the schooner Grace Darling, suggested that the anchor was one which had been lost off that vessel.
The Marine Board in Adelaide held an inquiry on 2 May 1902 into the loss of the Franklin and found that:
in approaching the anchorage at Port Malcolm, owing to the incomplete nature of the surveys, it would have been prudent to have shaped a course well outside of known dangers, and it would have been advisable if the master had taken cross-bearings when rounding Point Malcolm to more accurately ascertain his position. The board further were of the opinion that the vessel struck a rock immediately after anchoring. There was no evidence that this danger was charted or known (Advertiser, 3 May 1902: 7).
INITIAL SALVAGE
The passengers, mails and the cargo (which had been only slightly damaged) were landed.
On the morning of Sunday 20 April the owners of the Franklin, The Adelaide Steamship Company, despatched the steam tug Euro (Captain W.T. Wills) from Adelaide. On board were their marine superintendent, Captain Dingle, a diver named W.J. McArthur, a carpenter and the necessary equipment to salvage the stranded steamer. On arrival they found the Franklin to be lying on a hard, very uneven, limestone bottom, with its bow pointing north-north-west. The ship had a list to seaward with 11 feet (3.5m) of water on the port side and 14 feet (4.3 m) on the starboard. Although No. 1 hold was dry, the other three holds and the engine room had water in them to the level of the sea outside. The ship was grinding on the rocks in the swell and had buried its keel about a metre into the limestone. Two of the propeller blades had also dug into the seabed, and as the ship rocked these caused the engine to work. The diver was sent down to ascertain where the damage had occurred. This proved to be impossible due to the sea being milky from the crushed limestone caused by the working of the stranded ship, and by the fact that the bottom was buried in the rock. It was thought, however, that the leak was on the starboard side under the boiler, a position impossible to reach and repair.
The salvage team used a 10-inch pump to try and empty hold numbers 2 and 3, and also the stokehole in which was 200 tons of coal. Rising seas caused the Franklin to heel over more, and shift its position. The work became too dangerous and it was decided that the wreck should be abandoned. When the weather moderated slightly a day or so later the crew again managed to get on board. The engineers were then able to remove the steam steering gear and their salvage pump.
An Albany newspaper reported:
The fate of the steamer Franklin, which stranded off Point Malcolm on Friday, April 18, has now been sealed. A wire received from Israelite Bay, dated April 26, states: “The steamer Franklin has been abandoned as a total wreck.” (Albany Advertiser, 26 April 1902: 3a).
The Euro left to return to Adelaide on 26 April bringing back from the wreck, as well as the crew of the Franklin and the salvaged steering gear, a large quantity of ship’s stores, two lifeboats and a dinghy.
The relatively new boiler was later removed from the wreck through a hole cut in the ship’s side. This boiler was then towed to Adelaide by the steamer Ballarat, and later used in the ship Investigator.
At an auction conducted by J.H. Weidenhofer in Adelaide on 2 May 1902 the wreck of the Franklin was sold to H.W. Thompson of Adelaide for £17.10.0; the price included everything remaining on board.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Franklin lies about one kilometre eastward of the track down to the beach at Point Malcolm, with part of the engine visible above sea level.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck of the Franklin lies 500 m offshore on a stone and weed bottom, in 5-6 m of water. A wreck inspection in January 1995 by the Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum, noted that part of the engine projects some 2 m above sea level. The iron structure has largely fallen apart and the wreckage lies flat on the bottom on a north-south axis. It is heavily overgrown with kelp.","NO","Scotland","20","1995/01/12","","3.57","Two cylinder compound steam engine of 162 HP","2009/0121/SG _MA-53/95","Y","Y","-33.7858","","61.00","55.00","123.7621","","0.00","79328","Glasgow","Adelaide","","Fremantle","GPS","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

OLD DREDGE SUNK.
End of the Fremantle.
Towed by two motor launches, the hulk of the old dredge Fremantle, which was sold in January to Mr. J. E. Hall, of Fremantle, for scrap, was taken out of the harbour yesterday morning and sunk near the Stragglers, a series of rocks seven miles due west of the harbour. It was intended originally to beach the remains of the dredge near the wreck of the old State steamer Kwinana, at: Rockingham, and break up the two hulks simultaneously; but it was stated yesterday by Mr. Hall that owing to the guarantee required that work would be completed within a stipulated time it was not worth the trouble. The work of dismantling the dredge has been proceeding at Victoria Quay for several weeks, and little except the shell remained yesterday.","Scuttled","150.00","","1894","908","Iron","","","Shipwreck","Metro (S Fremantle)"

"Gael (of Nante)","1909/08/24","165 miles off Cape Leeuwin","Atel. & Chant. de la Loire","Celtique Maritime","Captain Desire Meteye","Ship started leaking 165 miles off coast, thirty seven degrees south","N","12.20","","Full cargo of cement","413","  Gaël was built by Atelier & Chant de la Loire at St Nazaire and had one deck, two tiers of beams, a poop 20.4 m long and a forecastle 15.6 m in length. The vessel was owned by the firm of Celtique Maritime, and the master was Desire Meteye with a crew of 24. Captain Meteye was 46 years of age and had spent 30 years at sea.
The Gaël had suffered a previous incident in early June 1905, having taken on a cargo of iron ore at Port Pirie in South Australia for Antwerp. Shortly after commencing the voyage the vessel struck heavy weather described as a ‘fearful storm’ (Western Australian, 28 August 1909: 12d). The deck was swept by waves and the vessel rolled substantially. It gave one especially great roll and did not come back upright, so the crew realised that the cargo had shifted. The vessel was put about and managed to make towards Adelaide, which it reached without further incident. Investigation showed not only a major shift in the cargo, but also some broken frames and other structural damage. This required placing the Gaël in dry-dock for repair. As there was no such dock at Adelaide, the tug Wato was employed in towing the Gaël to Melbourne for repairs.
On 29 March 1902 the French steel barque Ville d’Orleans developed an uncontrollable leak due to extremely rough weather and sank 440 miles south west of Tasmania. The crew were rescued by the Gaël (Nicholson, 1993: 551).
 The Gaël was carrying a full cargo of cement, when it left London on 23 May 1909 and then called at Cherbourg on 26 May for the bounty paid to French sailing vessels at that time. Good weather prevailed until the vessel approached the Australian coast.
THE LOSS
The Gaël met with strong winds and heavy seas in mid-August, and on 17 August it was found to be taking on water. There was 1.2 m of water in the hold so the steam pumps were put into action. This proved unsuccessful and the water continued to gain. The crew resorted to buckets rigged to tackles to supplement the pumps, but still the water continued to rise. Captain Meteye jettisoned much of the cargo, however five days later, on Sunday 22 August, he decided to abandon ship. He estimated his position then to be at latitude 36° 44’ S and longitude 111° 47’ E, approximately 170 nautical miles south-west of Cape Leeuwin.
The three ship’s boats were lowered, but one was smashed against the side of the barque. One of the two boats saved was a 2-masted lug-rigged (also with jib) lifeboat 23.5 ft (7.16 m) long with a beam of 6.25 ft (1.91 m) and a depth of 2.8 ft (0.85 m) into which the first mate, Maurice Gerard, and 12 crewmen took stores and water. This vessel had air tanks running down each side of the hull and was therefore unsinkable. It was equipped with seven 18 ft (5.5 m) ash oars. The captain, the second mate, Joseph Veandes, and ten crewmen took to the other boat, of about the same length but more lightly built and without air tanks, having instead cork fenders around the gunwale. They also took plenty of provisions and water. Each boat had a sextant, chronometer and some charts, together with oil for use in rough or broken water.
The boats stayed by the sinking Gaël on Sunday and Monday (23 August), but between 7.00 and 8.00 p.m. on the Monday evening, after going on board the Gaël and finding 3.4 m of water in the hold, the mate decided to sail for the nearest port. The captain stayed until the barque sank at about 11.30 p.m. when he too set sail, intending to head for Albany.
Three days later the mate’s boat was seen by the staff at the Cape Naturaliste Lighthouse and the tug Vigilant (Captain Coalstad) was sent from Bunbury to meet them. The lifeboat had tried to enter Bunkers Bay but was driven back by the wind. It was picked up at 4.00 p.m. some 30 km from the cape and less than 15 km from Busselton, to which the crew had been heading. They were then taken on to Bunbury.
When word reached Fremantle, the Chief Harbour Master immediately ordered the tug Dunskey to depart Albany and search for the captain’s boat. At the same time the Penguin was despatched from Fremantle to join the search, with the Vigilant to stand by at Bunbury.
Meanwhile Captain Meteye had reached the coast at Flinders Bay, and at about 3.00 p.m. on Wednesday 25 August he decided to attempt to go ashore. In landing, the boat was capsized in the surf and everything including the ship’s papers was lost. The following day, after camping that night on the beach, the castaways found a case of preserved milk and a barrel of biscuits. This sustained them while they endeavoured to find help. Following a bush track they met W. Pickersgill, a possum trapper, who lead them eight kilometres to the timber mill at Jarrahdene. Here the manager telephoned his superior at Millars Karri and Jarrah Company at Karridale, who sent a train to collect the exhausted survivors.
INQUIRY
There does not appear to have been an inquiry in Western Australia on this foreign owned vessel. Captain Meteye considered that the Gaël had sprung some plates in the heavy weather that they had encountered, and this had caused the uncontrollable leak.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The mate’s lifeboat, its gear, and the stores remaining in it were seized by the Customs authorities at Bunbury.

"Geffrard","1875/06/12","Quindalup","","Fred Clark of Melbourne","Captain Munday","Chain parted and beached","Y","7.36","","Timber","","Geffrard was built at Jersey in the Channel Islands, having one deck, a square stern, and a male figurehead. It was copper fastened and sheathed with felt and yellow metal. The brig had undergone replacement of the keelson in 1862 and major repairs in 1866. From launching until 1862 it was owned by Pirchet & Co., and from 1862 until 1873 the owner was Orange & Co., of Jersey. In 1873 the brig was sold and re-registered in Melbourne, afterwards sailing mainly from that port to Shanghai, but occasionally calling at Western Australian ports en route.
On 12 June 1875 the Geffrard had taken on board a full cargo of timber for Adelaide and was anchored in 4½ fathoms (8.2 m) of water about 1½ miles (2.8 km) from the Quindalup Jetty, which bore SW by W½W. Captain S. Munday went ashore that evening to complete the ship’s business with Henry Yelverton, the supplier of his cargo.
There are two dates given for the loss of the Geffrard. The evidence at the Court of Inquiry indicated Sunday 13 June (quoted in Henderson, 1988: 162), while a newspaper reported the brig as being lost on Tuesday 15 June (Inquirer, 23 June 1875: 2d).
THE LOSS
At 6.00 a.m. on the morning of 13 June a fresh breeze blew up from the north, quickly reaching gale force. At 7.30 p.m. an anchor chain on the Geffrard parted, and the mate George Allen, who had been left in charge while the captain was ashore, immediately let go the starboard bower anchor, paying out 45 fathoms (83 m) of cable. This cable also parted and the fore topmast staysail and the main lower topsail were then set in an effort to save the vessel. The Geffrard however continued to drift and, because it was drawing 0.6 m more at the stern than the bow, first struck the bottom with the aft end of the keel.
To help hold the vessel steady (by this time it was lying on its port bilge) the mate kept the topsail set. The Geffrard was still being pushed by the wind and waves, and finally came to rest, according to a newspaper report, some 2.5 km east of the jetty. A report by the police constable at Quindalup stated that the vessel was on a sandbank about half a mile (800 m) offshore.
INQUIRY
On 21 June 1875 a Preliminary Court of Inquiry into the loss of the Geffrard was held at the police station at Quindalup. This was followed by a Court of Inquiry held at Busselton on 7 July 1875. It found that there was no blame attached to Captain Munday, although it was considered that he was imprudent in not laying to two anchors as was local practice. In his defence, Captain Munday said that he had found that the barometer on board indicated the approach of bad weather when it read 29.60 inches or less. When he had left the brig to go ashore, it had shown 29.90 inches, by which he felt that the weather would remain fair.
INITIAL SALVAGE
On 17 July 1875 an advertisement calling for tenders to unload the cargo of timber from the wreck of the Geffrard was followed on 28 July 1875 by the following advertisement in the Inquirer:

Fremantle, July 27, 1875.
At the auction the hull of the Geffrard was sold to Elias Solomon for £200 and the cargo to William Silas Pearse for £413 (Inquirer, 11 August 1875: 2b). The timber merchant Henry Yelverton bought all the fittings from the wreck of the Geffrard. The ship’s bell hung outside his office for many years and was used to call his employees to work. It was eventually donated to the Busselton Primary School.
SITE LOCATION
Two expeditions by archaeologists from the Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum, in 2009 and 2011 found wreckage consisting of iron knees, copper bolts and timber at a site about half way between the wreck marked on Archdeacon’s 1876 chart (see page 169) and the shore to the south. This is almost certainly the wreck of the Geffrard. The bank in this area was still known to older residents as Geffrard Bank in the 1940s and 1950s, although the name never received official recognition.

"General Gordon","1889/20/06","At sea off Geraldton","","Alfred C. Jolly of Darwin","Captain Ware","Gale, rudder lost, abandoned","N","5.90","","Stone Ballast","","General Gordon was a two-masted topsail schooner built in NSW in 1885. It had one deck, a fiddle head and a round stern. It is stated as being not very strongly built. The schooner was owned by Alfred C. Jolly (Cairns & Henderson, 1995) or Messrs Jolly and Luxton (Totty, 1979), of Darwin. The vessel had left Darwin on 10 March 1889 with 30 tons of general cargo for Port McArthur, Northern Territory. The master was William Ware, with a crew of five, and his instructions were that after discharging the cargo he was to sail to Cossack and try to sell the schooner. After discharging the cargo at Port McArthur the General Gordon took on ballast consisting of clay and sand. However, the vessel leaked and the clay and sand as it puddled, shifted and then clogged the pumps. The ballast was replaced with stone at Lewis Island in Hampton Harbour. Not being able to sell the schooner at Cossack, Captain Ware sailed for Fremantle to see if a sale could be made at that port. The vessel continued to leak during the remainder of its voyage.
THE LOSS
The General Gordon departed Cossack on 1 June 1889. The weather was fine until 16 June, when a gale from the north-west struck and continued until 18 June. By this time the vessel was some miles south of Dongara and well offshore. As the weather moderated Captain Ware went below to rest, but was recalled on deck with the news that the rudder had gone. The blade had sheared off leaving the stock, but because of its method of construction this could not be unshipped to make repairs. Large canvas bags were therefore made and placed over the side, then towed astern from each quarter to act as drogues. This enabled the schooner to be steered by heaving on one or other of the ropes. As the wind had by now swung to the west south-west, the General Gordon was turned by using the drogues and headed towards Champion Bay. The vessel appears to have been strained by the adverse weather, and the leaks worsened as the wind again increased. The rudderless General Gordon eventually became unmanageable, and was abandoned about 12.30 p.m. on 20 June 1889, when about 30 miles from Champion Bay. The crew left in the dinghy, and arrived near Geraldton about midnight the same day. They had no knowledge of the port, so anchored off until 7.00 a.m. on 21 June when they came alongside the jetty.
INQUIRY
An inquiry was held at the courthouse in Geraldton on 24 June 1889 before Maitland Brown and Charles Crowther. The finding was that there was no blame attached to the master or crew, as the storm had caused the loss of the General Gordon’s rudder.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Captain Ware considered that, despite the leaks, the General Gordon might still be afloat. She was a fairly new vessel and was, even though strained, still in fairly good condition. The cutter Una was sent to search for the General Gordon but no trace was found.","NO","NSW","6","","","2.30","N","117/80","N","N","","","20.10","","","","","89366","Cape Hawke","McArthur River","Sydney","Sydney","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

"Geographe’s Chaloupe","1801/06/05","Wonnerup Area","","","","","","2.70","","","Aus 755 & WA 859","THE VESSEL
The Géographe and the Naturaliste were two corvettes under the command of Post-Captain Nicolas Baudin sent by the French Government on a voyage of discovery to the south-west, west, north-west and north coasts of New Holland in 1800. The Géographe carried a number of boats, but the biggest was the chaloupe or longboat. There is little information on the size of this boat. However there are at least two drawings of it from which some deductions may be made. The Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle at Le Havre in France has a collection of paintings and drawings from that expedition. Item number 16090 is entitled ‘Camp on an elevated coast’ (Bonnemains, et al, 1988: 112). This depicts a longboat heading in towards a rocky shore where there is a French camp. This boat has two masts on which are set what appear to be lateen or settee sails. Baudin states in his journal that his longboat was ‘easily distinguishable because of its sails’ (Baudin, 1974: 177). The boat has a high, arched transom and is shown with six oars. On board can be seen a number of people, one of whom is standing by the aft mast.
There is another drawing/etching, held in the Musee de la Marine, Paris, which shows the Naturaliste arriving at Kupang in Timor, with the Géographe already at anchor. Alongside the Géographe is a longboat with two masts, each having furled lateen or settee sails. This boat has a man standing near the stern, and a good idea of the size of the boat can be seen from its relationship both with this person and with the corvette alongside.
The Géographe was a corvette, having a length of 124 feet (37.8 m) and a beam of 30 feet (9.14 m) (Baudin, 1974: 577). As the vessel carried all the boats on board, and did not normally tow them except on short trips, this limited the size of the boats that could be carried. One boat was hung on stern davits, but it is not known whether this was a longboat or the large dinghy (grand canot), but most probably the latter. In either case the length of the boat was considerably less than the beam of the corvette. This boat can be clearly seen in the frontispiece to Baudin’s journal, and in the illustration used on the writing paper prepared for the expedition (Bonnemains, et al, 1988: 3).
A further indication of the size of the longboat can be obtained from Baudin’s journal. He describes the loss of his longboat (the one built at Timor to replace that lost at Wonnerup Inlet) in Bass Strait on 15 December 1802 when the Géographe was sailing to King Island. When it arrived at the island some of the crew were immediately sent to cut timber with which to build a replacement longboat. This longboat was built on the deck of the Géographe, work commencing on Christmas Day of 1802. Some timber for planking and curved timber for the bow was later cut while the vessel was at anchor at Kangaroo Island, as the corvette gradually explored westward. While still at anchor on 29 January the longboat was tipped up to lie on its beam ends so that measurements could be taken of the bottom, presumably to cut and fit the bottom planks. ‘This work could not easily be done once we were at sea, because our other boats would have hampered us too much’ (Baudin, 1974: 471).
This longboat was completed on 9 February:
On board we busied ourselves with the last of the work on our longboat, which, with its masts, sails and rigging, was finished during the day. We shall thus be in a position to use it when the first opportunity arises and I trust that the fate of this third one will be happier than that of the two others (Baudin, 1974: 477).
A probable size for the longboat would be a length of between 8 m and 9 m, a beam of about 2.7 m and a depth of 1.2 m. It was a seaworthy, strongly constructed workhorse, used to carry kedge anchors and casks of water. ‘…the longboat had to operate in all weathers, under oar or sail. She had to be stout and large enough to carry out all these tasks, yet at the same time be light and short enough to be hoisted aboard’ (Lavery, 1987: 218). ‘Apart from the lines, the general character of man-of-war boats was much alike – whether Dutch, English, American or otherwise – and they were of much the same construction’ (Petrejus, 1970: 121). May (1999: 58) quotes the dimensions and scantlings of Royal Navy boats ‘around 1800’, and gives the lengths of the five different sizes of longboats as ranging from 19 feet (5.8 m) to 32 feet (9.75 m).
THE LOSS
On 5 June 1800 the two corvettes were anchored north of the Wonnerup Inlet. Baudin sent off one of his longboats under the command of Le Bas de Sainte Croix with a party of scientists to examine the inlet, which had been reported by sub-lieutenant Heirisson of the Naturaliste as a large river or lake. The boat left the Géographe at 3.00 a.m. and headed south in a fresh north-east breeze to start the survey.
The wind freshened considerably during the morning from the north-north-east, and when the boat had not returned by evening lights were kept burning at the mizzen mast-head to guide its expected arrival. It still had not been sighted the following morning, and it was not until 9.30 p.m. that the commander of the Naturaliste, Jacques Felix Emmanuel Hamelin, came on board and reported to Baudin that the longboat had been stranded near the beach. It had been left anchored in the charge of two sailors while the others had gone ashore, and had been thrown on its beam ends by a large sea and then filled by a following wave. The crew and scientists were unharmed, but they had lost everything except a small quantity of rice, some biscuits and a barrel of gunpowder. Losses included the scientific equipment, a number of firearms, food and some specimens collected by the scientists.
INQUIRY
Baudin carried out an inquiry on board the Géographe in which general blame was apportioned to all those involved, including seamen, officers and scientists, but no punishments were carried out.
INITIAL SALVAGE
At 4.00 a.m. on 7 June, Baudin made ready his large dinghy and sent it with the master carpenter to the Naturaliste with a note instructing Hamelin that he was to have the Naturaliste’s dinghy accompany the carpenter and show him where the longboat lay. Hamelin was then to sail at first light, and have the Naturaliste stand in as close as possible to the stranded men so that he would be able to render assistance if needed. A note was also written to Le Bas de Sainte Croix telling him that the boats sent to his aide had ‘everything you may need for refloating the longboat, if it is possible’ (Baudin, 1974: 180). Baudin advised him that if the longboat could not be saved without further risks it was to be abandoned. 
The Géographe’s boat returned about 4.00 p.m. having brought off all the men, but abandoning the salvage equipment due to lack of room on board. The master carpenter reported to Baudin:
I consider your longboat lost, because it is impossible to work at it. The sea is too rough and unless there is calm weather for several days, it will not be quiet at the place where the boat is.
This longboat has sunk completely and is covered by more than 2 feet of water. It is, moreover, quite full of sand and is so embedded, that it makes a shallow of more than 5 feet in circumference, upon which one may walk as if on a platform. I do not think that the longboat has been damaged, but, unless there should be a spring-tide when the sea would go out far enough to leave it uncovered, it is useless to try getting it off the sand. Had I seen it for myself before the dispatching of all the articles that we have lost, I could have saved you the additional loss of all the things that I left behind, being unable to put them back in the boat which was intended to take everyone to the ship (Baudin, 1974: 184).
The items lost included ‘tackle, grapnels, pulleys, gear, masts, planking, pliers, jacks, etc., etc., which had been left behind and which I greatly regretted’ (Baudin, 1974: 183).
Later that day a small dinghy from the Naturaliste, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Bernard Milius, in attempting to salvage some of this gear left on the beach, lost one man, Thomas Timothée Vasse, who was washed away by a wave as he was attempting to reach the dinghy from the shore. Due to the darkness and violence of the waves he could not be saved, and was presumed to have drowned. 
In late August 1801 the Géographe and the Naturaliste voyaged to Kupang in Timor to obtain food and water. While in that port Baudin had Francois Ronsard, the naval engineer, and the master carpenter take a work party and fell suitable trees for the construction of a replacement longboat. This work was carried out, and on 3 September 1801 ‘the keel, stem and stern-post of the longboat were laid down. The length of this boat and its other measurements are somewhat greater than those of the one we lost’ (Baudin, 1974: 265). Subsequently this boat was lost in Bass Strait and a replacement built on the deck of the Géographe with timber cut on King and Kangaroo islands as the corvette sailed west along the south coast of Australia as described above.","","France","","","","1.20","","","","","","","89.00","","","","","","","","","","","","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

Connor","Captain John Godfrey","Leak developed","Y","6.90","","Passengers, Jarrah, sundries","BA 413"," Georgette was built as a collier by McKellar, McMillan & Co. at Dumbarton in October 1872. When originally launched the steamer had the official number 68004. It was clinker built and had one deck, four bulkheads and a round stern. The vessel, which was cemented, was rigged as a 2-masted topsail schooner with a capacity of 460 deadweight tons. It had a raised quarterdeck 19.2 m long and a forecastle 6.9 m long. Smith Bros & Co., Glasgow, built the 2-cylinder compound engine, which gave 24 HP per cylinder.
Thomas Connor of Fremantle bought the single screw steamer in the UK for £14 000, the vessel arriving in Fremantle in September 1873. The newspaper reported that it was to be ‘re-christened the Western Australia’ (Inquirer, 30 July 1873: 2d), but this obviously did not occur. The following month it grounded on Murray Reef, springing some of the plates, and was in imminent danger of sinking as it steamed to Careening Bay for repairs. After these repairs a regular contract mail service was established between Champion Bay and Albany, calling in at intermediate ports. This contract was operative until it expired in September 1876. During this period the Georgette also made some voyages to Adelaide where the vessel was overhauled, especially after being stranded on the reef in October 1873. On 29 November 1876 Connor mortgaged the Georgette to John McCleery, merchant of Fremantle, for £2?000.
On 24 November at Bunbury the Georgette took on a cargo of 145 loads of jarrah valued at £870. Some large pieces were 30 cm square and over 9 m long, and during the loading one of these pieces fell into the hold. The steamer sailed that night for Fremantle where further cargo consisting of 25 bales of leather, two casks of whale oil and 260 hides was loaded. The total value of all the cargo was £1 257.10s. The Georgette departed Fremantle on 29 November for Adelaide via Bunbury, Busselton and Albany. On board were 50 passengers, two for Bunbury and 48 for Adelaide. The stops at Bunbury and Busselton were of short duration, and it left the latter port during the afternoon of Thursday 30 November.
THE LOSS
About midnight on 30 November the Georgette developed a leak. None of the pumps on board, including the steam pump, worked, and the water rose so that at 4.00 a.m. on Friday 1 December Captain Godfrey had the crew and some of the passengers bail with buckets. The vessel was steered towards the coast, but at 6.00 a.m. the rising waters put the fires out and the steamer lost all power, so the sails were set and the vessel headed for the shore, still some kilometres away. A letter from James and William Dempster to their parents described some of what took place:
You will be glad to know that my brother William and I got off in the rush for life that took place at the wreck of the Georgette. After leaving Fremantle we got on all right to here (Vass), where we arrived on Thursday about eight o’clock, and started on again about 10 a.m. I noticed some of the crew pouring water into the pump of the engine before the ship started, which shows that it must have been out of order. After rounding Cape Naturaliste the sea was rather rough and so continued all night, but nothing to hurt a ship that was in the least bit seaworthy. I was on deck about 2 am, when all seemed right. I turned in again, but was awakened about half-past five by the men being sent down the lazarette to bail out the water. I think there was more noise than water at that time, as the men did not seem to have their buckets more than half full, the water at that time being not much over the ballast. We went on deck again about 6 a.m. and found that there was no less than eight feet of water in the engine room, which showed that the leak was in that compartment, no water being reported in the fore hold. The crew were bailing out with buckets, but it was gaining fast on them. The ship’s head was turned for shore and she appeared water-logged. The engine fires were extinguished by the water directly after the ship’s head was turned for land. This must have occurred between 4 and 5 am, our position being about 30 miles S.W. from Cape Hamelin. [See note at end of this section—author]
Between 7 and 8 a.m. the lifeboat was lowered, but being very leaky it was soon half full of water. The water was got under a little by bailing with a bucket, and three men and about fourteen women and children were put into it, when she was passed astern for more bailing, as she was full of water quite up to the thwarts, women and all bailing for dear life. Meanwhile my brother William saw that the smallest boat had broken away a ring bolt and was getting stove in against the steamer’s side. He slid down the other fall and called out to the crew to lower away, which was done. They threw him a bucket and passed him aft, as the boat was up to the thwarts, but before he had her free the lifeboat was again hauled alongside and some more women and children put into her. She then got under the ship’s counter and immediately filled with water. Five of the occupants made a spring for the ship’s deck, some made a rush for the side next the ship, and the boat capsized on a lot of the poor women and helpless little children.
My brother seeing the inevitable consequences of the calamity, pushed his boat up as close as he could and helped those in the water onto the boat, but he had not strength to get them in, as there were so many all on one side and the boat was very full of water. I saw him try his utmost, but the boat’s gunwale went clean underwater. The cabin boy jumped overboard but missed the boat; he then managed to get on the bottom of the lifeboat. I caught hold of an oar, pulled off my coat, and quickly jumped over the stern to go to my brother’s assistance. I was lucky enough to come up close to the boat, but on the opposite side to where the women and children were clinging to it. My brother caught hold of my hands and helped me in, and we then got the young children on board. I went aft and passed the first woman I could get hold of round the stern on to the other side, and held her there until my brother helped me get her and the others into the boat. They on board the ship pulled our boat under the steamer’s stern and the first mate got in. They then cast us off from the ship to pick up the second mate, who jumped overboard after I had got into the boat but had missed her, and was sitting on the bottom of the lifeboat with the cabin-boy.
Our first effort was to get our boat bailed out, and we had to make throwel [sic] pins before we could do anything. We then went in search of the other boat, which we soon found and pulled up close to, when those on her bottom jumped off and we soon had them on board. They were of course delighted to see us, as they were beginning to despair. By this time the Georgette was over a mile from us, heading for shore, with a freshening breeze. We had no chance of overtaking her, so we shaped our own course for shore. The sea was too high to head directly for shore, so we edged in as much as possible; James being kept constantly bailing. It was at this time that we were exposed to great danger, for the wind continuing to rise the sea had got up to a great pitch, and the difficulty of keeping the boat free increased instantly.
We were still in no enviable condition—twenty miles off the Leeuwin, in a small and very leaky boat, without sails or rudder, and only three oars, with a crew of ten adults and ten children, all wet through and miserable. I wanted to rig a blanket we had, but the others thought the sea too rough, and preferred pulling, but it was slow work with only two oars and a very heavy sea, the wind being right on our beam and freshening fast. We kept on this way until about 4 p.m., when we rigged a towel forward, which made a great alteration in our speed and kept the boat freer of water. We then got our blanket rigged, using one of the oars for a mast and a bit of batten from the boat’s bottom for a yard, and got along well until 10 p.m., when we got close in shore and were fortunate enough to find a place to land without much danger, about 15 miles south of Cape Naturaliste, the surf not running very high. We all got ashore in safety, but were all thoroughly drenched. Willie, the chief officer and two of the sailors started off shortly afterwards and obtained food and help from a neighboring [sic] homestead—Mr. Harwood’s, in reaching which Willie and the chief officer were occupied the whole night, being greatly baffled by timber tracks running in all directions (quoted in Inquirer, 10 January 1877: 3c).
Author’s note: This should read ‘Cape Naturaliste’, and was either written in error by the Dempsters or misquoted by the newspaper.
A bullock team took these particular survivors from their landing place near the Quininup Brook to Yelverton’s sawmill at Quindalup on the Saturday night. The group consisted of William Dundee (1st mate), John Dwyer (2nd mate), A. McLeod (seaman), James Noonan (cabin boy), James Dempster, William Dempster, Miss Walsh, Mrs Herbert Dixon and child, Mrs Simpson and child and Mrs Stammers and two children.
Shortly after sunrise on the Saturday 2 December the Georgette had blown onto a sandbank ‘two ship’s lengths from shore’ (Inquirer, 6 December 1876: 3a) near the mouth of Calgardup Brook where the third lifeboat was used to attempt to take a line ashore. During this attempt the boat was capsized and swamped by 2-m high waves, but recovered and returned to the steamer where some of the passengers were transferred to it, and it again headed for the shore. Once again the boat was capsized, and two local residents, Sam Isaacs and Grace Bussell, rode horses into the surf to assist in the rescue of these survivors.
The schooner Ione left the Vasse at 7.00 a.m. Sunday morning to go to the scene of the disaster but was unable to reach the Georgette. It did, however, pick up some of the crew and passengers who had come ashore at Calgardup and took them to Busselton.
INQUIRY
The nautical surveyors, Messrs Storey and Owston, travelled from Fremantle aboard the steamer Start, collecting Captain Harris of the Charlotte Padbury at Bunbury en route. The three disembarked at Busselton and travelled overland to the wreck site of the Georgette.
A Court of Inquiry into the loss of the Georgette, commenced at Busselton on 21 December 1876, was made up of five members; the subcollector of Customs, William Pearce Clifton, John Brockman, J.P., George Forsyth, harbour master, William Eldridge, engineer and Navigating Lieutenant William Tooker, RN. They heard five charges brought against Captain John Godfrey, together with other charges against a further three members of the crew:
1. That without due regard for the safety of the ship he took in a large quantity of jarrah timber hastily, violently and incautiously, thereby injuring the vessel and causing her to leak, resulting in the loss of the vessel and lives of passengers.
2. That he proceeded to sea with an insufficient number of boats, these not being seaworthy.
3. That he placed passengers in a leaky boat, the upsetting of which caused the loss of several lives.
4. That his Chief Officer did not have a certificate of competency or service.
5. That the ship’s pumps were damaged and not in good working order (Henderson, 1988: 211).
The hearing concluded on 26 December, and Captain Godfrey was acquitted of all five charges, but the court found that he was guilty of a grave error of judgement in not taking further steps to ascertain the condition of the ship at 8.00 p.m. on 30 November, when the engineer reported the unsatisfactory working of the bilge pump. The first engineer was acquitted of the charge of neglect of duty in not having reported directly to the captain the unusual quantity of water in the ship. The second engineer was found guilty of neglect of duty in not having taken steps to ascertain the cause of the leak, which he had noted when he first came on watch on the evening of 30 November. The mate was found guilty of disobedience of orders in not veering the lifeboat astern, when directed to do so by the captain—loss of life resulting from such disobedience (Inquirer, Supplement, 24 January 1877: 1d).
The nautical assessors, Tooker, Forsyth and Eldridge, while concurring with the findings also considered that the captain was guilty of grave misconduct in regard to charge number three, that is, in placing passengers aboard the leaking lifeboat considering the state of the wind and sea at that time.
An assertion had been made prior to the inquiry by some unnamed passengers to the sub-inspector of police at Bunbury. They believed the ship had been deliberately scuttled. This assertion must have been investigated but dismissed at a fairly early stage in proceedings, as it was not a charge brought against the captain or crew.
The certificate of the master, John Godfrey, was suspended for eighteen months. The mate, William Dundee, had his certificate of competency cancelled. The first engineer was acquitted of the charge, but the second engineer, Joseph Hourigan, had his certificate suspended for 12 months. A newspaper later reported that these suspensions were deferred ‘pending the decision of the government as to the necessity or otherwise of further proceedings’ (Inquirer, Supplement, 24 January 1877: 1e).
The Court of Inquiry suggested that a charge of manslaughter be brought against both the master and the first mate. The mate was arrested on 27 December, brought before a court where the hearing was remanded for eight days. The captain was also charged, but ‘the warrant is stayed until further instructions is received from headquarters’ (Sub-inspector of Police, Bunbury, SRO 129, File 24/31). The outcomes of these two charges are not known.
With regard to the first charge, in his reminiscences, Happenings through the years, Edward Henry Withers wrote that he had helped to load the timber into the Georgette prior to its sailing on 30 November 1876. He claimed that the falling timber would not have damaged the hull of the steamer, as there were already three or four pieces of timber of the same size in the hold, and these would have absorbed and spread the shock. He stated that this had happened on previous occasions without causing any problem. No action was taken by the court on the first charge as it could find no evidence of ‘hasty, violent or incautious loading at Bunbury, or that any injury to the ship was caused thereby’ (Inquirer, 24 January 1877: 1d). In the opinion of Withers the Georgette had struck something after leaving Busselton, thereby damaging the hull. He was the last worker to leave the vessel at Busselton, and claimed that at that time the steamer had been very low in the water.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Sergeant Back of the Busselton Police Station reported on 2 December:
A report was received by the police from John Brockman Esqr. J.P. who lives near the wreck to the effect that the passengers & crew of the wreck Georgette was plundering the Ships Stores & passengers Luggage. I then sent a constable with chains & Handcuffs out at once with instructions to the police to render every assistance in their power and to detect plundering of property (SRO 129, File 24/31).
In January 1877 the Inquirer advertised the auction of the Georgette:
This day: Sale of the Wreck of the S.S. Georgette and her cargo of timber—Messrs. Lionel Samson & Son (Government Auctioneers).
The Wreck of the Georgette with her machinery, engines, spares, and etc., as she now lies off Calgardup Gully, near the Margaret River, about 34 miles south of Cape Naturaliste.
Also the whole of her cargo of timber consisting of 546 pcs Sawn Jarrah (about 140 loads) in sizes of 5x5 to 12x12 in lengths from 14ft to 40ft, 10 pcs hewn timber.
And LASTLY—the unsaved portion of the remainder of her cargo consisting of Whale Oil, Leather, Hides, etc.
The Whole Without Reserve Sale at noon sharp (Inquirer, 10 January 1877).
The ship’s bell from the Georgette was retrieved by two sons of Henry Yelverton, and was given to one of Yelverton’s daughters when she married the postmaster at Jarrahdale. The couple gave the bell to St Paul’s Anglican Church at Jarrahdale, but the church officials on finding that it was cracked purchased a new bell. The bell from the Georgette was then taken home by a local farmer and is now on loan to the Augusta Museum, which also holds a number of small items such as portholes and a steam pipe from the wreck. A small cabinet from the captain’s cabin is held in the Busselton Museum.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Georgette lies just offshore of the mouth of Calgardup Brook, south of Redgate and is marked by a cairn and plaque on the shore.
SITE DESCRIPTION
A wreck inspection on 8 February 1980 by Michael McCarthy of the Western Australian Museum reported that the wreck of the Georgette lay about 100 m from shore in 5 m of water on an axis of 100°, with the bows pointing towards the shore. During the inspection the outline of the hull was barely visible as it was heavily corroded above the sand line. The engine (with piston block torn off), propeller shaft, sternpost and the lower part of the hull were visible, together with part of the bow and an anchor winch. Part of the wood ceiling was visible just forward of amidships on the starboard side, and copper pipes and other fittings lay among the wreckage. A hand winch was seen about 5 m from the bow. Evidence of scouring results in different sections of the wreck being visible at different times.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
In March 1964 the 4-bladed iron propeller (almost 3 m in diameter) from the Georgette was salvaged by divers, but was later lost when heavy seas buried it under sand on the beach. The bell from the Georgette is on display at the Augusta Historical Museum.
  Located by members of the UEC, its engine was dismantled for the brass fittings and in March 1964  a propellor removed and dragged ashore, only to be lost. Despite a magnetomer search led by J. Green it has not been found. The bell is in the Augusta Museum.","NO","Scotland","","1990/12","12","3.50","2-cylinder compound vertical, double-acting 48 HP","2009/0123/SG _MA-428/71","Y","Y","-34.042317","","46.20","","114.999515","","","10755 (I.J.

"Governor Endicott","1840/07/08","Toby Inlet, Geographe Bay","","J. and W.P. Randall","Captain McKennistry","","N","7.98","","Whaling oil","1034, 335"," Governor Endicott was built as a ship, having two decks, a square stern and a figurehead, and was registered at Salem on 1 May 1819. On 13 March 1823 the rig was altered to that of a brig, and then to that of a barque on 19 April 1836. The barque was sold to Charles K. Holmes in 1838 for $6 000. The Governor Endicott departed Mystic, Connecticut, in December 1839 under the command of Captain Thomas McKinstrey (or McKennistry) with a crew of 30. It arrived in Geographe Bay on 5 July 1840 and anchored off Toby Inlet.
THE LOSS
On the evening of 7 July 1840 the breeze freshened from the north-east, then shifted north-north-east and increased in ferocity. More cable was let out on the best bower anchor, and the starboard anchor was let go. At about 11.00 p.m. the Governor Endicott began to drag its anchors and, despite paying out a further 30 fathoms (55 m) of cable on the starboard anchor, it continued to drag and struck heavily. Briefly freeing itself, the ship dragged a little further then struck again, heeling to leeward. The fore and main masts were cut away. The pounding seriously damaged the stern post and rudder, and an examination showed water covering the second tier of casks in the hold. The Governor Endicott finished only about twice its own length from the shore and about two miles (about 3.7 km) west of Toby Inlet.
The following morning a boat with the third mate (Hempstead) and a crew of five managed to get a line ashore. This enabled all the crew to gain the shore safely. Tents made from old sails were set up to shelter them and some provisions that they had salvaged. The storm quickly subsided. Subsequent inspection by local residents determined that one of the anchors had fouled its cable, and therefore it had not properly held:
The loss of the Governor Endicott, American Whaler…arose from a now evident cause—a foul Anchor, as the cable is now to be seen in the Water with a Turn round the Fluke of the Anchor, besides when the Gale was comparatively moderate before it was near its height, she went on shore (Letter from John Molloy to his wife Georgiana Molloy, quoted in Hasluck 1966: 229).
INITIAL SALVAGE
The Governor Endicott was sold at auction for £400 to Francis Coffin, master of the Samuel Wright wrecked at Koombana Bay in the same storm (see entry), and who paid a further £300 for all the gear connected with it. Coffin also purchased the wreck of the Samuel Wright at an auction about the same time. He gradually dismantled much of the Governor Endicott, selling the salvaged material to local buyers.","NO","USA","30","","","3.99","N","112/80","N","N","","","29.97","","","","","","Salem, USA","Mystic","Mystic, Connecticut","Fishing ground","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

Date lost:	2 February 1914 (Newspaper article quoted in Marshall, 2001), 3 February 1914 (Chief Harbour-Master's report to The Under Secretary dated 9 March 1914 and the Decision of the Court of Marine Inquiry dated 18 March 1914), 4 February 1914 (Marshall, 2001), 11 February 1914 (Dickson, 1996),
	4 February 1914 appears to be the correct date
 Grace Darling was built at Battery Point in Hobart for Henry William Hopwood. It was carvel planked with a square stern and a medallion head. The vessel was sold to Thomas Edwards of Melbourne on 28 November 1870 and registered in Port Fairy. The Grace Darling was subsequently sold to W. Tulloch of Adelaide and registered in Port Adelaide in 1873, where it worked in the wheat trade. During this period the vessel was involved in a collision with the Amelia on 8 February 1883 in Avoid Bay, as a result of which the Amelia sank. Later the Grace Darling also rescued two survivors of the wreck of the schooner Experiment from Kangaroo Island. The schooner made voyages along the south coast of Western Australia at least as far as Geographe Bay, as in early September 1874 it is recorded as being stranded there after the anchor cable parted in a storm.
The Grace Darling was purchased on 12 May 1892 by Fred Douglas of Albany, and used in the coastal trade along the south coast between Fremantle and Adelaide. It must have been a fast vessel as it completed one trip from Esperance to Albany in nineteen hours. During this period it earned a good reputation, and became noteworthy for the rescue of the 196 passengers and crew of the iron steamer Rodondo from South East Island, about 128 km from Esperance. At one stage the Grace Darling was stranded on Middle Island for six weeks.
The Grace Darling was sold on 1 September 1910 to R.J. Lynne Ltd, shipowners and coal vendors of Fremantle. It then traded from Fremantle to Geraldton and northern ports. On 27 April 1913 it sprang a leak and had to put in to Geraldton for repairs. At that time it was valued at £600 and was carrying cargo to the value of £2?000.
THE LOSS
There is a difference in the dates given for the wrecking of the Grace Darling, but the early morning of Tuesday, 4 February 1914 appears to be correct. The schooner, under the command of Captain Frederick Schroeder and five crew, left the Abrolhos Islands on 28 January 1914 loaded with 1?000 bags of guano (a full cargo), bound for Fremantle. Captain Schroeder was the only person aboard who held a certificate for, being less than 100 tons register, the Grace Darling was not required to have a certificated mate. There were two compasses on board, both correct according to the master. After a position fix at noon on 3 February 1914 he allowed 20 miles leeway for possible currents setting his ship towards the shore. At about 4.10 a.m. on 4 February 1914 Captain Schroeder and the mate were both below deck, although it was Captain Schroeder’s watch. There was a strong wind blowing. The vessel, steering south-east by south and doing between 4 and 5 knots, ran onto the reef at Edward Island. The schooner was laid over on its beam ends.
Captain Schroeder ordered the mainsail lowered. His intention was to make for the mainland, about 800 m away, in the boat. Four of the crew got into the ship’s boat and held onto a line from the ship. Unfortunately the crew’s hold on the ship was broken in the rough seas and the oars washed away. This left the master and the cook, who had been collecting provisions, stranded on board the schooner. The fishing boat Wanderer (Captain Johnson), which had been anchored some 3?km away, picked up the men in the dinghy. It then went to the aid of the master and cook on the Grace Darling. These two endured four hours of constant battering by the waves until rescued. The Grace Darling broke up some ten minutes after their rescue.
The Wanderer took the rescued men to Fremantle, where Captain Schroeder was taken to hospital suffering from broken ribs and bronchitis. No cargo or crew’s belongings were saved. Captain Schroeder’s Master’s Certificate (No. 173 issued at Fremantle in 1897) was later picked up on the beach.
INQUIRY
The Chief Harbour-Master held a Preliminary Inquiry on 9 March 1914 at Fremantle, and a charge of careless navigation was laid against Captain Schroeder. A Court of Marine Inquiry consisting of Mr E.P. Dowling R.M., Captain Abrahams and Captain Yates, and Mr J.P. Dwyer (for the Chief Harbour-Master), was held in Fremantle on 18 March 1914. The Inquiry found Captain Schroeder:
…negligent in the navigation of the vessel while on a voyage from the Abrolhos Islands to Fremantle which said negligence resulted in the wreck of the said vessel on Edward Island on 3 February 1914. The Court therefore suspends the Certificate of the said Frederick Shroeder for three months.
Captain Schroeder’s explanation of the wrecking was that there must have been a strong set inshore. He had made allowance for leeway and had considered the vessel to be further offshore. According to a contemporary newspaper article, the mate, Lachlan McLean, had disappeared after the survivors landed at Fremantle and therefore did not give evidence. Only Captain Schroeder and the helmsman at the time of the wrecking, Joseph Doherty, spoke at the Inquiry.
INITIAL SALVAGE
As the vessel had to be abandoned in a hurry and subsequently broke up, nothing was salvaged. Its cargo of guano would have been irrecoverable. The vessel was valued at about £1?000.
SITE LOCATION
On the southern tip of Edwards Island near Lancelin, inside the reef in 4.5–6 m of water
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
There have been artefacts recovered from the wreck since its registered discovery on 5 May 1971. These include an anchor, a piece of planking, timber spars with copper bolts and a piece of cement ballast. The ship’s bell and a small compass were reported to have been recovered in September 1957 and sold to Les Douglas for £20.","NO","Tasmania","6","","None","2.50","N","2009/0125/SG _MA-19/86","Y","Y","-30.999756","","25.10","","115.316477","","","57502","Hobart Town","Abrolhos Islands","Fremantle","Perth","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

Prescott","Gale, parted cables","N","7.38","","Timber","1472","Greyhound was built in Wivenhoe, UK, and had one deck, an elliptical stern and was sheathed with yellow metal. Initially owned by Newman and Co. and used primarily in the Baltic trade, it was purchased by Captain Lloyd of Hobart in 1868 for £2 750. It traded regularly between southern Australian ports, Singapore and other Asian ports, and Mauritius. The brig was described by the newspaper as ‘a tight handy little craft’ (Inquirer, 29 October 1884: 2f). By 1884 the owner was Captain Alfred C. Prescott, of Port Adelaide, and he was the master at the time of the loss. He had taken the Greyhound on two voyages to New Bedford, USA, in the months before being wrecked. The vessel had arrived at Hamelin Bay from Samarang in Java on 13 October 1884, and was loading timber for Madras in India.
THE LOSS
The Greyhound was at anchor at Hamelin Bay when a north-west gale caused the anchor chains to part at about 9.00 p.m., and the brig was driven ashore two hours later about a mile (1.6 km) north of the jetty. After beaching the brig heeled over, with its deck towards the beach and with seas breaking over it. At 6.00 a.m. the following morning the crew got ashore, but without any of their personal possessions. The next day, 20 October, the brig began to break up and much of its deck planking washed ashore.
INQUIRY
A Court of Inquiry was held at Vasse on 1 November 1884 by J.S. Harris, subcollector of Customs, and S. Bompass, J.P., which found that Captain Prescott and crew were not to blame for the loss of the Greyhound, having taken every reasonable precaution to ensure the safety of the vessel.","NO","UK","","","","4.30","N","112/80, 196/75","N","N","","","37.80","","","","","21593","Wivenhoe, Essex","Samarang, Java","Melbourne","Madras","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

"Hadda","1877/04/30","Off Beacon Island","","William Johnston of Newcastle, New South Wales","Captain John Lewis Parker","Strong current pulling it off course","Y","","","Guano","AUS 332"," Hadda was built in Germany in 1860, and in 1877 was owned by William Johnston of Newcastle, New South Wales. It was under charter to the Melbourne firm of Poole, Picken and Company who were involved in the guano industry. The barque, under the command of Captain John Lewis Parker, with a crew of eleven, was en route from the Lacepede Islands in ballast. Parker was making for Fremantle in order to obtain the correct licence papers from the Commissioner of Crown Lands in Perth to enable him to load guano.
THE LOSS
The Hadda was heading south-east by south when, despite setting a course that should have taken it through the Geelvink Channel and well clear of the islands, it struck the reef close to Beacon Island at 10 p.m. on the night of 30 April 1877. According to the captain the vessel had been difficult to steer in the following north-westerly winds and seas. Immediately after it struck, the vessel began to take in water. Sail was lowered and the boats took anchors out in an attempt to kedge the barque off the reef. As it had run right up onto the reef this proved futile. The crew remained aboard the Hadda until 7 May when, with the water up to the vessel’s lower deck beams, they abandoned it and sailed with a favourable wind for Geraldton. They arrived there the following day, suffering from exhaustion and exposure.
INQUIRY
A court of inquiry was held on 11 May in Geraldton before Resident Magistrate George Eliot, Charles Crowther, JP and Captain Andrews of the steamship Rob Roy acting as nautical assessor. The hearing exonerated Captain Parker, as it found that the Hadda was wrecked due to being set off course by a strong westerly current. Although the Houtman Abrolhos were well charted by this time, there was still little known regarding the currents in the vicinity.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The wreck of the Hadda was auctioned at Geraldton on 10 May 1877 and was bought by Captain Parker for £150. Also sold at the auction were the two ship’s boats, the larger fetching £28 and the smaller £11 11s 0d. The cutter Moonlight left for the wreck site on 16 May, and it is presumed that subsequent salvage was carried out as the wreck lies in waters protected by all except northerly winds. The absence of heavy but salvageable items such as ground tackle and the rudder and its fittings, including the upper gudgeons from the stern-post, lends support to this assumption.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Hadda lies 720 m ENE of Beacon Island, Wallabi Group, Houtman Abrolhos.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck lies in a gully at the edge of a coral reef in depths ranging from 2 to 5.6 m. It is oriented in a SSE to NNW direction and covers an area of about 40 m by 19 m. There is a substantial amount of the hull remaining, particularly a large portion of the port side. Other wreckage includes the starboard garboard plank; the keel; 45 iron hanging knees which joined the deck to the hull; deadeyes; a chain plate; various fastenings and the port hawse pipe.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
The site was located by the Museum in 1970, and further fieldwork was carried out in 1973, 1975, 1980, 1981, 1986, 1992 and 1999. A number of artefacts were recovered both from the wreck site and from Beacon Island. These included two rudder gudgeons; ship’s fastenings and fittings; a brass pulley; part of a grindstone; brass sheeting; glass and ceramic fragments.","NO","Germany","11","2004/03","","","N","2009/0127/SG _MA-2/81","Y","Y","-28.472267","","","","113.792417","","","61014","Sundahaven","Lacepedes","","Fremantle","DGPS","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

"Halcyon","1844/08/05","Toby Inlet, Geographe Bay","","","","Cables parting in heavy gale","N","7.50","","Whale oil","1034, 335","Halcyon was built as a brig in the state of Maine. In 1842, after a sale to a consortium of ten New London businessmen, it was converted to barque rig. At that time it had two decks, a square stern and a billet head. In 1844 the barque was partly owned by the firm of Havens & Smith of New London. It had sailed from New London on 2 August 1843 for a whaling voyage under the command of Captain William G. Bailey with a crew of 26. After successfully whaling along the south coast of Western Australia the vessel sailed to Geographe Bay, and just prior to 5 August 1844 was anchored at Toby Inlet. On board were some visitors from Bunbury.
THE LOSS
At 11.30 a.m. on Monday 5 August 1844 a storm caused the Halcyon to part its port anchor cable together with the spring on the starboard cable. This spring had only been replaced a matter of minutes when the starboard cable itself also parted, leaving the vessel without anchors. As it drifted towards the shore the captain feared that the seas, described by the press as ‘awfully high’ (Inquirer, 21 August 1844: 2c), would wash the crew from the deck. He therefore ordered the foretopmast staysail set. This payed the barque’s bow towards the shore where it struck a reef, unshipping the rudder. The vessel swung broadside to the wind, and the seas then broke over the deck. The foremast was cut down, causing the Halcyon’s head to veer off the shore and the barque came to rest in the shallows a little over 3 km west of Toby Inlet.
The storm continued unabated until the Thursday following the wrecking, at which time crew and visitors could at last get off the Halcyon. An attempt to launch a boat on the Wednesday evening had resulted in it being capsized in the seas, fortunately without loss of life. Those trapped on board must have had a difficult few days: ‘Mr Penny [Charles Penny] and some gentlemen from Bunbury, who were on board felt very uneasy, and expressed great anxiety to join their friends at home’ (Inquirer, 21 August 1844: 2c).
INITIAL SALVAGE
An advertisement appeared in The Inquirer (28 August 1844: 4a) for the sale by auction on 11 September of the Halcyon.
To Be Sold By Auction—On Wednesday, the 11th of September, at 11 o’clock, as she now lies near the beach about 2 miles distant from Toby’s Inlet, at Port Vasse.
The hull of the American barque Halcyon, three whale-boats, masts, sails and rigging, her try works and whaling gear, casks to the capacity of 1,200 barrels, 400 of which are in shooks; and, if not previously disposed of by private sale, about 1,000 lbs of whalebone, and 600 barrels of oil.
The vessel is most advantageously placed for the establishment of a fishery, having about nine feet water alongside, and lying within a cable’s length of the shore.
Terms—cash.
Applications for purchase of bone and oil may be addressed to Captain Jeffrey, Post Office, Vasse.
John Molloy and Alfred Bussell jointly bought the hull for £60 in order to use some of the timber to build a schooner, which they named the Conservative. While the Conservative was still under construction Bussell pulled out, selling his shares to Molloy who continued construction. But when the vessel was almost ready for launching a gale washed the props from under the hull and the schooner fell on to its side (see entry). Molloy then dismantled the Conservative, using some of the timber which had originally come from the Halcyon to build his house ‘Fairlawn’ near Busselton.
The Halcyon’s whale-boats were bought by Thomas Habgood for use in his proposed bay whaling venture at the Vasse. Joseph Morris bought the rigging for use on the brig River Chief which was then being built for him on the Murray River.","NO","USA","","","","3.80","N","112/80","N","N","","","28.50","","","","","","edford, USA","","New London","","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

THE VESSEL
The Harlequin was owned by Elder and Co. of Adelaide, departing that port for Singapore on 3 August 1850 under the command of Captain Welsh (or Welch) with a crew of eight, and was to call at Albany and Fremantle en route. The captain’s wife of one month was also on board. A newspaper criticized the condition of the rigging of the schooner stating that ‘she was most shamefully found in every respect, and had hardly a whole rope from stem to stern’ (Gazette, 27 September 1850: 2c). The schooner was carrying a very mixed cargo listed by a newspaper as:
937 cakes of copper, 1009 tiles ditto, 116 ingots ditto, 6 bales leather, 20 bags flour, 8 bundles iron, 1 pkg tins, 2 carroteels currants, 17 boxes raisins, 6 ditto wax candles, 12 kegs vinegar, 1 hhd sugar, 300 bags flour, 1 case glassware, 1 cask soda, 1 ditto whiting, 1 box starch, 1 ditto blue, 1 bale bacon, 1 bag nuts, 1 brl walnuts, 5 casks peas, 5 cases oatmeal, 220 bags flour, 8 ditto sugar, 1 case cheese, 5 boxes soap, 1 bale wool bags, 1 case ironmongery, 1 box tea, 2 bags sugar, 2 casks, 2 cases, 1 bundle, Nicholson; 25 bags sugar, Owen; 15 tierces beef, Collinson; 110 boxes soap, Samson; 10 casks beef, 10 bags potatoes, 1 bale leather, Owen (Perth Gazette, 20 September 1850: 2c).
The total weight of the cargo of copper was 30 tons and it was insured with the Adelaide Marine Insurance Company for £2 500. The Harlequin arrived at Albany on 22 August, and after discharging part of the cargo of flour (some 6 tons shipped by W. Owen) and sugar, cleared on 26 August and anchored in King George Sound awaiting suitable weather.
THE LOSS
The Harlequin departed King George Sound on Sunday 1 September 1850 and had sailed to a position 36º 49’ south and 114º 51’ east, south-west of Cape Leeuwin, when on 2 September a severe gale struck from the north-west. The schooner lost all its sails and was driven back. The gale then swung to the south-west, and at 3 o’clock in the morning of 4 September the Harlequin was driven on to the coast to the west of West Cape Howe, ‘a locality of the most fearful description for such a mishap, the coast consisting of almost perpendicular rocks of granite, near 200 feet high, and the water at the base having a depth of ten fathoms’ (Gazette, 20 September 1850: 2c). The vessel very quickly began to go to pieces, and three of the crew, the cook, a seaman and a cabin boy, were drowned. It was later stated that the seaman was drunk and made no effort to save himself. Mrs Welsh was three times washed off a spar that the crew were using to help get her ashore. On each occasion she ‘regained it by swimming, an art of which she was before entirely ignorant! and only knew by description’ (ibid.).
The cook attempted to save his life by grasping at the dress of Mrs Welsh, who had gained a small rock; and as his efforts threatened the loss of her life, and could not save his own, his hold was broken off by one of the sailors, and he sank (Inquirer, 18 September 1850: 2c).
Mrs Welsh had been asleep below, and was dressed only in a night dress. The body of the drowned sailor was located on a ledge of rock, so his trousers were removed and given to her to wear. The survivors were saved by a sailor climbing the cliff with a rope, which, after fastening one end, he lowered to the others. This enabled them to climb the rocks, and finally Mrs Welsh was hauled up. In a letter to the vessel’s owners in Adelaide, an Albany resident, P. Belches, stated:
I know the spot where it happened; had she struck three or four times her own length either to the westward or eastward of where she did, none of the crew would have been saved (quoted in The Courier, 2 November 1850: 2).
The survivors then set off through the dense bush towards Albany, some 36 kilometres away, where they arrived exhausted but safe on the afternoon of 7 September. As destitute seamen they were provided with board and lodging, paid for by the Government Resident at a cost of 12 shillings each per week. Captain and Mrs Welsh and four of the crew were later taken to Adelaide on the brig Calder, which had been sailing from Singapore to Adelaide and had called in at King George Sound.
INITIAL SALVAGE
A newspaper advised of the sale of the wreck of the Harlequin:
By a letter we have received from our correspondent at Albany, we hear that the wreck (or rather the remnants) of the ill-fated Harlequin, consisting of kelson, forefoot, capstan, chain, and anchors, and all she had in her, were sold by Auction for the benefit of the underwriters, for the sum of £45 (Perth Gazette, 1 November 1850: 3b-c).
The purchasers were James Cooper and John Williams. Despite Captain Welsh having stated after inspecting the wreck site that the cargo was irrecoverable, Cooper and Williams recovered one ton of copper only a few days after purchasing the wreck. This copper was presumably on a reef, as the paper stated that there was only two feet (0.6 m) of water over it, and that the rest was clearly visible. The salvors confidently expected to recover it. They also hoped to be able to raise the ‘sheet lead, chain, anchors, &c., worth £100 more’ (ibid.).
There is also a reference to Aborigines bringing copper bars to a farmer living in the vicinity of the wreck, and some salvage by local people using a bullock team, the salvaged material being sold in Albany (MA 195/72).
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Harlequin lies on a rock ledge on the second small beach west of West Cape Howe, below a steep, rugged gully. This gully is known as Copper Gully, and was where salvaged material was hauled up for loading on carts at the top of the cliff. The position is approximately eight kilometres west of West Cape Howe, and 400 metres east of Bornholm Beach.
SITE DESCRIPTION
Although Scott Sledge of the Western Australian Museum attempted a wreck inspection of the Harlequin in December 1974, he was unable to dive on the site due to the dangerous surf. This is a feature of the site, and the Museum has been unable to accurately plot the exact position of the wreck. In September 2001 Don Phillips reported the finding of an anchor and a bale of raw rubber. The anchor may have come from the Harlequin; the rubber would have most probably been from the wreck of the Michael J Galoundris (see entry). Besides this anchor and another close by, there is further site some 70 metres away where material has been found which may have come from the Harlequin. Taking into account the often violent wave conditions at this site, the wreck material may be scattered over a considerable area.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
The Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum, has recovered a number of artefacts from the wreck of the Harlequin including a large shackle, rudder gudgeon and a hook.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
The cargo on board the Harlequin gives an insight into the wide variety of goods carried between developing state economies in Australia and older established trading partners on the Indian Ocean rim.
SOCIAL (3)
The circumstances associated with the rescue of Mrs Welsh are a pointer to the social mores of the day. It appears that the life of the cook was deliberately shortened in order that she could be saved.
On a lighter note, the newspaper reporter was obviously astounded that she could swim, having never done so before!
REPRESENTATIVE (8)
The Harlequin is representative of the many smaller vessels which traded around the Australian coast and to ports such as Singapore and Port Louis in Mauritius.

Coastal search widened
PERTH: A search for six fishermen lost at sea off the north-west coast of Western Australia since last Friday has been widened. Karratha police said yesterday the search of waters off the coast of Onslow, 1386km north of Perth, had been extended to include nearby Barrow Island.
Three fixed-wing aircraft, a helicopter and a number of boats are involved. The six missing men were on the fishing boats Harmony and Lady Pamela
when they were caught in fierce seas as Cyclone Bobby
battered the town of Onslow on Friday night. The wrecked hulls of both
vessels were found about 10 nautical miles north of Onslow at the weekend, and the body of a woman, believed to be Janine Callow, 26, of Mudgee, in central NSW, was found on the Harmony three days ago.
The body was flown to Perth on Thursday for an autopsy and identification
by dental records.

On 2 July 1908 the hulk Herschel, having been previously stripped of anything of value, was towed by The Bruce to Inner Island to the north-west of Cape Vancouver and abandoned.

It was launched in November 1871, and had one deck and a round stern, one bulkhead, no galleries and a female demi-figurehead, and had been cemented. The barque was owned by the brothers John and David Spence of Melbourne (registered Melbourne 23 of 1872). It had left Newcastle, NSW, on 7 October 1872 with a cargo of 426 tons of coal for Mauritius, under the command of Samuel Findlay with a crew of eleven. Captain Findlay had been around Cape Leeuwin ten times previously, often, according to him, closer in than he went on this occasion. His chart was dated 1858. This was the maiden voyage of the Hokitika.
THE LOSS
At noon on 2 November 1872 the Hokitika was estimated to be 10 or 12 miles off Cape Leeuwin with a south-westerly wind blowing. A bearing taken at that time by the second mate, James Hunter, showed Cape Leeuwin bearing N by E (11°). The vessel was heading NW by ½W (about 310°), and it was doing 8 knots. The course was maintained until suddenly about 3.00 p.m. the vessel struck, and then struck again. There was a heavy swell running and nothing to indicate shoal water. Estimates of the distance from land when the barque struck were 15 or 16 miles by the captain, and about 14 miles by the second mate.
The pumps were immediately manned, and a sounding showed 3 ft (0.9 m) of water in the hold, but within 20 minutes this had risen to 6 ft (1.83 m). The barque immediately stood in for the land, and a short while later had 10½ ft (3.2 m) of water in the hold. About 45 minutes to an hour after striking, the Hokitika foundered in about 30 fathoms (55 m) of water some 5 miles offshore.
The crew took to the two boats and reached shore near a small creek (probably Turner’s Brook just south of Cape Hamelin). The following morning (3 November) they made towards the north, reaching Busselton at noon on 5 November 1872.
INQUIRY
On 18 November a Preliminary Court of Inquiry was held before John George Slade, Resident Magistrate, John Frederick Stone, J.P. and acting collector of Customs, and Edward Marsh, captain of the barque Fitzroy, nautical assessor, which recommended an appearance before a Court of Inquiry. The subsequent court, composed of Leonard Worsley Clifton, collector of Customs, John Frederick Stone and Edward Marsh reached the decision that:
After careful consideration of the evidence the Court is of the opinion that no blame can be attached to the master, mate, or any of the crew of Hokitika on account of her loss on an outlying danger off the Leeuwin on 2nd day of November, 1872 at 3 o’clock p.m. (quoted in Herald, 30 November 1872: 3d).
INITIAL SALVAGE
With instructions to search for the wreck of the Hokitika, and to place above the high-water mark ‘any Valuable Property found Drifted on Shore from the Recent Ship Wreck near Cape Luen [sic] on or about the 2nd inst.’, police constable Thomas Stack arrived at Augusta on 15 November 1872. On the beach he found a water barrel, many planks (he thought them to be from the deck) and half a ship’s yard with some rigging still attached. After questioning the settlers at Augusta he also obtained eight cabin doors, a chest of drawers (very little damaged), two chairs, part of a bed and some planks, all originally collected by Michael Bredy [Brady?] and his wife. However Constable Stack did not find the wreck (Police Daily Occurrences Book, Blackwood Station, 15 November 1872). On 26 February 1873 police from Quindalup travelled to Augusta to collect further articles that had come ashore from the wreck of the Hokitika.
The only other items saved from the wreck were the two boats in which the survivors reached shore. These were subsequently sold at Busselton.
SITE LOCATION
The second mate thought that the Hokitika was about six or seven miles (11–13 km) from land when it sank. A report by Constable Richard Furlong stated that Captain Findlay reported to him that the Hokitika went down in 30 fathoms (55 m) of water, five miles (9.3 km) from shore.
The distances from Cape Leeuwin given in evidence at the Court of Inquiry by the crew of the barque appear to be over generous. In contrast to his statement to Constable Furlong, Captain Findlay claimed at the Court of Inquiry that the Hokitika was 15–16 miles (27.8–29.6 km) from the shore when it struck. It is probable that the vessel was pushed northwards towards the coast by a current which, according to the Admiralty Pilot ‘is subject to variability, and after strong southerly winds, especially in summer, may be found running, temporarily, northwards…Currents, with considerable rates, have been experienced setting towards the land, in the vicinity of the cape at all seasons of the year’ (Australia Pilot Vol. V, 1959: 422). Nicolas Baudin aboard the corvette Géographe experienced just such a current in this area in January 1802, and wrote: ‘It seemed to us that a strong current must have carried us very rapidly North’ (Baudin, 1974: 295). On 10 January 1822 Phillip Parker King in the Bathurst, sailing north after rounding Cape Leeuwin, also reported a strong current in this area. ‘At six o’clock in the evening we passed Cape Naturaliste, having experienced a strong current, setting N11ºW, at nearly two miles per hour…’ (King, 1969: 160). Such a northward setting current may well have contributed to the loss of the Hokitika.
It is interesting to note that Commander W.E. Archdeacon, a highly regarded naval surveyor, intimated to the Colonial Secretary considerable doubt as to the accuracy of the evidence presented at the Court of Inquiry. He also expressed serious doubts about the sobriety of the master and the first mate, and considered that the vessel had probably been taken much closer to the cape than was prudent. He reported that ‘a herd boy, on the coast in the vicinity of locality where the ship sank, stated that the vessel was [so] close in that he saw the people on her decks’ (Archdeacon to Colonial Secretary, 6 December 1872, CSR. 727, folio 216). This would indicate the vessel was very much closer to the coast than the distances given in either of the master’s statements, or that of the mate.
There are many rocks in the area between Minns Ledge and Cape Leeuwin that may trap a vessel sailing too close to the coast. After passing Cape Leeuwin and being set to the north, the most likely unseen dangers to be encountered would be Cumberland Rock, 8.3 km north-west of Cape Leeuwin and about 2 km from the shore, although with a height of 10 m above sea level this should have been easily seen and avoided. Another possibility is Geographe Reef, about 7.5 km offshore and 15 km west-north-westward of the cape. This latter reef consists of two steep-to rocks only 180 m apart, and having less than 2 m of water over them. Minns Ledge, to the east of them, is another danger; however, as it stands 1.8 m above water it would most likely have been seen and avoided.
According to the captain’s evidence after having struck, the Hokitika was sailed towards the land, taking on water at a very rapid rate before sinking some 45–60 minutes later. The wind was south-westerly and the speed of the barque was 8 knots prior to striking. This speed would probably have dropped to only a knot or two, and therefore the vessel would most likely have sunk only two to four kilometres from the scene of the accident.","NO","Scotland","11","","","3.70","N","112/80","N","N","","","40.40","","","","","64775","Aberdeen","Newcastle","Newcastle","Mauritius","","Protected Federal","'Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., (in press).

  Hugh Norman was built by Alfred Edmund Brown at Fremantle. The owners were Robison & Norman Ltd, merchants of Broome. It was on its delivery voyage under the command of W. Dundee when wrecked. The date of 1928 as the date of wrecking in McKenna appears in error, and 1910 is correct although the exact day is in dispute. McKenna (1959) states that the registry was closed on 8 February 1911 and cancelled on 1 May 1911.
THE LOSS
McKenna (1959) states that the Hugh Norman was ‘totally wrecked in vicinity of Cervantes Is’. However McKenna (1967) shows the place of wrecking as ‘near the mouth of the Moore River’. Dickson (1996) states that it was wrecked in the vicinity of Cervantes Island. WAM File MA-118/80 shows that it was wrecked in the vicinity of Cervantes Island, owing to the skipper being drunk. Goldsmith gives the full story and states that the date it struck the reef was 24 October 1910.
The Hugh Norman was due to depart Fremantle on 20 October when the authorities detained it because the skipper was hopelessly drunk and obviously incapable of properly sailing the vessel. The schooner sailed the following morning, after the owner’s agent had confiscated what he thought was the only remaining bottle of liquor aboard. Anderson, the only crew, was given the course to steer and the master went below. Later that day when the wind increased the crewman went below to ask Dundee what needed to be done. He found the master drunk again with two whisky and two methylated spirits bottles rolling around empty on the cabin sole. The wind continued to increase but the task of altering or reefing sail required two men, so Anderson could do nothing except steer, until at dusk on 21 October the foremast snapped.
Captain Dundee came on deck about 8.00 p.m. but made no effort to clear the wreckage of the mast trailing alongside, and went below again. Anderson continued steering until just after sunset on 22 October when the skipper again came on deck and finally took over the helm. Anderson cut away the foremast and its sail and rigging, and rigged a jury staysail on the mainmast. He then went below to sleep, but was woken the next afternoon by the flapping of the sails. He went on deck to find the skipper asleep at the tiller. Anderson took over the helm, and about midnight sighted land. He notified the captain who appeared disinterested. About 2.00 a.m. on 24 October the Hugh Norman struck a reef about five miles from shore.
An attempt was made to lower the ship’s boat but this became half swamped, the painter snapped, and it drifted away from the schooner. Dundee ordered Anderson to swim and bring the dinghy back, but Anderson refused, pointing to sharks swimming near the vessel. A fight ensured and Anderson suffered a severe bite to one of his fingers. The skipper then went below, where he stayed for two days as the vessel slowly drifted towards the shore, bumping over reefs as it went and with the leaks worsening. On 26 October the skipper came on deck and assisted with bailing out the water in the schooner. He then returned to his cabin. At 9.00 p.m. the following night Captain Dundee jumped overboard and attempted to swim for the shore.
In the afternoon of 28 October Anderson abandoned the Hugh Norman, which was by this time about one mile from shore. He made this decision because the wind had turned to the east, and he was afraid that it would blow the vessel back out to sea. After reaching shore he made an unsuccessful search for Dundee, then began to walk along a cart track that he came across. He followed this for five days with no food and little water before arriving at the homestead of Leslie Brown near Moora.
INQUIRY
A Marine Inquiry found: ‘The loss of the vessel was occasioned by the misconduct of the master, to wit, drunkenness and neglect of duty and navigation through excessive indulgence in intoxicating liquor. That as the master…lost his life in a vain attempt to swim ashore, no further action be taken’ (Quoted in Goldsmith, 1946: 194).
Alfred Edmund Brown, builder of the Hugh Norman, has been described as Western Australia’s most prolific boat and shipbuilder. At the peak of his production Alfred Brown was turning out a vessel every fortnight. Many of his boats were built for the pearling industry, but he also built yachts, barges and ferries. Some of his best known creations are the ferry Perth, the pearling lugger Aurora which at one stage held the record of seven days and twenty three hours between Fremantle and Broome, and the steam launch Ti-Tu presently held at the Western Australian Maritime Museum (Dickson, 1998).","NO","WA","2","","1","1.50","N","","N","N","","","11.50","","","","","125030","Fremantle","Fremantle","Fremantle","Broome","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

Preston","Captain Lane","Chaff choked pumps","N","4.20","","","1056"," Ione was built speculatively by Charles Watson at his boat building yard at Mount Eliza. It had one deck and an oval stern. Passed over by the Government for whom Watson had built many craft, it was purchased by John Bateman. In October 1879 a severe squall drove the schooner into the Bunbury jetty, badly damaging the stern and finishing up on the beach. The damage was repaired and the vessel returned to service. By 1880 the Ione was being used in the pearling industry. Bateman later sold the Ione to Florance Broadhurst, guano merchant of the Abrolhos Islands.
G.F. Preston purchased the vessel in June 1907. He planned to use it to carry copper ore from Cossack to ships anchored at Balla Balla, from whence the ore would be sent overseas. The Ione under the command of Captain W.H. Lane and with a crew of three sailed from Champion Bay on 1 August 1907 on its delivery voyage to Cossack. The northbound cargo consisted of furniture belonging to Lane for his house in Cossack, and some fodder. The value of the cargo was £50.
THE LOSS
On 2 August while off Port Gregory a northerly wind badly strained the rigging and opened seams in the hull. Although taking in water there appeared to be no immediate danger, so Lane turned and headed back towards Champion Bay to have repairs effected there. By the night of 3 August the vessel had opened up more, and the pumps were not coping. On the morning of 4 August the pumps choked, and Captain Lane decided to abandon ship. The crew took to the Ione’s 3-m dinghy. At this time they were some eight miles from Point Moore. After rowing in heavy seas for four hours they made the coast about three miles north of Geraldton. The dinghy capsized in the surf but all the crew made land safely.

McKay","Lost rudder, sank in heavy seas anchored close to shore","PA","","","","Aus 333 & DMH 329"," Irene was a double-ended, clinker built fishing boat with a whaleback decking covering three-quarters of the deck area. The owner was James Mackey. It had sand ballast, a 3 m dinghy on deck, two weeks of provisions and was well fitted out. The Irene left Fremantle on 1 April 1926 with Mackey and one crewman on board. They anchored overnight at Ledge Point, and later anchored for three days at Wedge Island because of bad weather from the north. When the wind changed to southerly the Irene left that anchorage and found shelter at Green Island. Here it was sheltered from winds from the south-east to the south-west. The vessel was forced to remain there for six days.
THE LOSS
When the weather improved Mackey decided to sail the Irene to Jurien Bay. After they got underway and were about 3 or 4 miles north of Green Island the rudder carried away, wrenching off the bottom gudgeon. This was near the outer reef, with another reef further offshore on their lee. The jib was hoisted and, using a dinghy paddle to steer, the vessel was taken through an opening in the reef and anchored 180 m off the mainland shore. Breakers were washing over the Irene, and several times swamped the dinghy they were trying to launch. Some food, matches, the compass and barometer were put into the dinghy, and Mackey went ashore with the crewman on board the Irene paying out a line made from running rigging stripped from the fishing boat. When Mackey was safely ashore the crewman pulled the dinghy back, and he himself then made the shore. By that time the Irene was awash and being pounded by the waves. The two left the beach at about 5.00 p.m. and walked east for 15 km before coming across a road. They travelled north towards Jurien Bay through the night, and the next day were assisted by people from a camp they came across.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Six days later in the Fisheries Department launch Kooruldhoo, Mackey and his crewman returned to the wreck site. They found the shore littered with wreckage but nothing could be salvaged from the Irene.","NO","","1","","","2.10","","","PA","N","","","8.50","","","","","","","Fremantle","","Carnarvon","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

Tonnage:	311 (Gibbs, 1990; Henderson, 1988: 26) or 271.59 (McKenna, 1959; Henderson, 1988: 28; Dickson, 1996)
  Iris was a three-masted barque with two decks, a square stern and scroll head. It had a standing bowsprit. E.C. Jones from New Bedford in the USA owned the vessel, so its place of building was probably that town. Whaling vessels fitted for a long voyage typically carried a number of whale-boats in davits and on deck. They also carried timber for repairing any boats damaged.
The Iris was an old vessel when it came to Western Australia, and is believed to have been whaling in the Pacific Ocean in the 1820s and 1830s. It then fished the Indian Ocean in the 1840s and 1850s (Henderson, 1988: 26). The Iris had left New Bedford in August 1854 on a whaling voyage to the Indian Ocean with C.S. Davak (Henderson, n.d., Research Notes) or E.S. Davoll (Henderson, n.d., Research Notes) or Edward Devoll (Henderson, 1988) or Deval (Gibbs, 1990) or Davok (Totty, 1979) as master, and a crew of 29 men. It is known to have been in King George Sound in March 1855.
After being wrecked and written off at Port Gregory, the Iris was later salvaged and taken to Fremantle, repaired and registered there as the Frances on 7 September 1856. It appears from the differing figures for tonnage, beam and depth that during the refit after the wrecking the Iris not only changed its name but also some of its dimensions. It was a fairly common practice when carrying out major repairs to a vessel to lengthen, shorten or otherwise alter some measurements to better fulfill a particular role.
The first owner of the Frances ex Iris was Richard Alexander Clinch, a merchant of Perth. Two months later Clinch mortgaged the vessel to Bickley & Co. to secure £430 at 10%. A further mortgage for £1?500 (but inclusive of the first mortgage) to the same firm was secured in January 1857. Only eleven days after that agreement another mortgage was taken out, again to Bickley & Co., this time for £337 10s?4d. On 21 January 1859 the vessel, still under the three mortgages, was sold to Charles Joshua Clinch who transferred it, and presumably the mortgages, to Wallace Bickley (one of the partners of Bickley & Co.) the following day.
Wallace Bickley re-registered the Frances at Fremantle on 25 January 1859. The barque was put up for sale at Madras, India, in June 1866 and its ultimate fate is not known.
THE LOSS
The Iris anchored at Port Gregory on 29 June 1855, having sprung a leak. Captain Devoll wished to careen his ship and needed a suitable, sheltered anchorage that he thought he had found at Port Gregory. However on the night of 9 July a north-west gale blew up, and at 3.00 a.m. on the morning of 10 July the Iris was blown ashore, fetching up on the sand spit opposite Gold Digger Passage. According to William Burges, the Resident Magistrate, in a letter to the Colonial Secretary dated 13 July 1855:
It was during a heavy gale from NW and strange to say the current carried her out against the wind, and the anchors seemed to drift faster than the vessel as if the whole bottom of the anchorage bodily gave way. She had an anchor out astern and it, all the time she was dragging, kept a strain on the cable. She went out stern foremost and had three anchors out, one of which came foul of the mooring chains of the large buoy, and all went away together.
The captain and his crew have pitched tents on the shore and are unloading the vessel with the hope of getting her off, which I think not at all possible. I have placed Constable Adams there to see that no robbing shall be committed and that no goods liable to duty shall be landed without my knowledge.
It is a curious fact that the vessel is now lying with her three anchors and the mooring buoy astern of her.
The crew was unsuccessful in their attempts to refloat the barque, and the Iris was condemned as a wreck in August 1855. The crew appealed to William Burges for assistance:

The American Consul, Thomas Pope, was obviously very reluctant to come to the aid of the crew, particularly the Portuguese members, despite the Advocate General pointing out to him that the Consul was responsible for American distressed seamen as well as ‘regularly hired seamen on board an American vessel’ (Advocate General to Colonial Secretary in Henderson, 1988: 27). While engaged in attempting to salvage the Iris, the Resident Magistrate had to resort to ordering the master to feed the crew from supplies salvaged from the wreck.

Rations will include 337 lbs salt pork, 236 lbs bread, 60 lbs sugar and 9 lbs tea also sufficient wood for the cooking of these rations.
W. Burges
After their failure to refloat the Iris, 27 of the crew were taken to Fremantle on the schooner Perseverence (the maximum number it could carry) to seek help directly from the American Consul. The other three were taken by the Rapid to Singapore.
INQUIRY
There was no inquiry held in Western Australia, as these were only held for foreign owned ships if requested by the diplomatic representative of that country after he received a Captain’s report on the event.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Captain Devroll salvaged and shipped 4?600 gallons (21?000 litres) of sperm oil to London. The crew of the Iris had also removed many items, and in October these were auctioned. Items included some sails, spars and rigging, together with a considerable amount of good whaling gear, and some food and clothing. As there was a great demand within the colony for whaling equipment, it seems very likely that gear from the Iris ended up being used in some bay whaling enterprise along the Western Australian coast, possibly at Port Gregory itself.
The Iris was purchased, along with spars and rigging, by Captain Bennett, previously master of the Eglinton that had been wrecked in 1852. Iris was refloated in January 1856. Temporary repairs were carried out and the barque set sail for Fremantle under jury rig. The makeshift rig was inadequate, so the vessel had to return to Port Gregory in order for further improvements to be carried out. It eventually arrived in Fremantle on 24 April 1856 and was taken to Careening Bay for careening so that proper repairs to the hull could be effected.
After repairs to hull and rigging, the Iris was re-registered as a British vessel (official number 40474) and renamed the Frances. Its first voyage under this registration was to Adelaide on 12 October 1856, carrying 150 passengers. Many of these people were artisans made redundant by convict labour that had become available in Western Australia after 1850.","NO","USA","30","","","5.00","N","117/80","N","N","","","29.60","","","","","40474","New Bedford","Fishing Ground","","Port Gregory","","Protected Federal","Iris (1855)

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
A previously foreign registered vessel that had been condemned as a wreck could not have been registered in Western Australia prior to 1850. At that time the law was altered, but even so re-registration of such a vessel must have been very uncommon.
REPRESENTATIVE (8)
The Iris was representative of the many American whaling ships that fished in Western Australian waters during the early part of the 19th century.

Sunk by naval gunfire from HMAS Parramatta and HMAS Yarra.","N","9.33","","","","The full rigged iron ship J.L. Hall was built by Marshall Bros, and launched in July 1859 with one deck, a round stern, two bulkheads, two tiers of beams and had been cemented. It was built for John L. Hall of South Shields. Sold to William Wells in 1872, it was registered at Port Adelaide as No. 11/1872. The next owners were Henry Simpson, Thomas Elder and Robert Barr Smith also of South Australia. This partnership was known as the Black Diamond Line. With the death of Henry Simpson in April 1884 ownership of the J.L. Hall passed to his son, J.L. Simpson, who retained the partnership with Elder and Smith. At this time the ship was given a new deck and the rig altered to that of a barque. It was again registered at Port Adelaide (No. 5/1884). In 1891 the brothers J.L. and W.A. Simpson became owners and the J.L. Hall was registered in their names at Port Adelaide (No. 6/1891). In 1895 they sold the barque to the Adelaide Steamship Company Limited.
In 1898 at Albany it was stripped for use as a coal hulk. This involved removing all but the lower masts, widening the hold hatchways and removing all accommodation apart from, usually, the captain’s quarters in the stern. This was kept for the hulk keeper and his family.
THE LOSS
In July 1916 the J.L. Hall was condemned, and after stripping it of any useful material it was taken to the area between Herald and Ledge points and sunk by gunfire from HMAS Parramatta and HMAS Yarra. The registry at Port Adelaide states:
Vessel condemned as unfit for further use. Handed over to Naval Authorities, for gunnery practice and subsequently taken out to sea and sunk. Advice from owners (McKenna, n.d.(c)).
SITE LOCATION
The exact position of the wreck of the J.L. Hall is not known, but an area of iron wreckage approximately 40 m to the east of the Athena wrecksite is believed to be possibly the remains of the hulk J.L. Hall.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The site measures about 10 m by 8 m, and if it is the remains of the J.L. Hall, would only consist of a small section of the hulk after being blasted apart by gunfire.","NO","UK","","","","5.97","N","195/72, 193/79","N","N","","","50.84","","","","","27045","South Shields","","Albany","","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

"James","1830/05/21","James Rocks","","Chapman and Company","Captain Edward Goldsmith","","Y","","","Passengers, cargo","AUS 117, 1058","James was an American-built vessel owned by Chapman and Company. The vessel was sheathed in copper (1828), carried two chain and one hempen cable, and was armed with three cannon. It had a single deck with beams, a raised new deck and new upperworks in 1828. The vessel was involved in the passenger trade from Europe. Captain Ellis met the vessel at Kingstown, Ireland, on 18 December 1829 and described the conditions aboard:
I found her crowded with passengers [of] the class of labourers, men, women and children, whom with passengers taken in at Kingstown, made the ship's crew 84 persons, and a quantity of sheep, pigs and geese... There was no place for goods, provisions etc. part of our accommodation was filled up with stores and luggage belonging to the ship. .There was scarcely enough room for 24 persons to eat and sleep... We therefore suffered great inconvenience and want of air particularly as the height between the decks in the greater part of our cabins is but 4'6"" between the beams and 4' to the beams instead of 5'6"" as required by Act of Parliament (Particulars of the Voyage from Kingstown Ireland (to Swan River in 1828 [sic] per brig James) of Capt. Ellis et al., quoted in Henderson 1980:101-2).
The journey was very difficult for all on board the vessel and Ellis demanded that a survey be made of the vessel once they had reached Bahia (Salvador). The captain of James, Edward Goldsmith, refused the request, and conditions continued to deteriorate. Five people died before 4 March 1830. James finally reached Swan River on 8 May, with twelve crew and 74 passengers and moored at Owen Anchorage.
The wreck event
On 21 May James was blown ashore along with the brig Emily Taylor. Captain Goldsmith refused to deliver passengers their goods until ordered to do so by the colonial secretary. Several incidents occurred involving injury to a man using explosives on the vessel, and another drowned during the transfer of goods by boat from the wreck to Fremantle.
Plans were made for the wreckage of the vessel to be incorporated into the building of a jetty but this never eventuated. There are no records to indicate James was ever refloated.
Site location
The site is adjacent to the South Fremantle Power Station, close to James Rocks, about 50 metres from shore. It is 81 metres south-east of the cooling water outlet pipe and the shore end is about 3.1 metres from the rocky sea-wall in front of the power station.
 Site description
The wreckage once lay on a sandy and rock bottom in 4 metres of water. It is significantly affected by sand movement in the area and is now  completely covered. Various artefacts have been removed from the vicinity of the site.
 Guns  recovered
In 1976, a carronade was found  about 600 metres from the James wreck site. This heavily concreted iron gun was removed from the site by Museum staff and after conservation treatment an excellently preserved 6­pounder trunnion carronade was revealed (Green et al., 1981:101). A gun carriage was later built for its display at the Museum.
A second gun, this time a small iron signal cannon which had been spiked, was found by  in the grounds of the abattoir some 20 kilometres from the wreck site. Research revealed it had been removed from the vicinity of the wreck and was probably the second of the three guns known to have been aboard. A third gun remains on the site.
Statement of significance
Technical and scientific
Analysis of the design of the carronade from the James wreck site may help in understanding the manufacturing process of these ordinances. Conservation of James's carronade has resulted in new methods of treating salt impregnated iron artefacts. The in situ analysis of the third remaining gun can also provide useful information.","NO","USA","12","1994","","3.60","N","2009/0134/SG _MA-133/76","Y","Y","-32.09576","","","","115.75861","","1.00","","","Liverpool","","Fremantle","GPS 2005","Protected Federal","Green, J.N., Henderson, G. and North, N, 1981, A carronade from the brig James: its history,

the north side of Woodman Point in
Cockburn Sound, by members of the
Underwater Explorers Club (UEC) who
were conducting an underwater line
search as part of their wreck research
programme.
Archival research revealed that
James Matthews was a snow-brig of 107
tons, registered at the Port of London.
The vessel was 80.2 ft in length, with a
breadth of 21 ft and a depth of 11.5 ft
(approximately 24.5 m x 6.5 m x 3.5 m). It had one deck, two masts, a square
stern, male bust figurehead and no galleries.
The James Matthews was a former slaver that operated under the name Don
Francisco, owned by Felis de Souza. The slave trade generally consisted of a
‘triangular run’, with ships travelling from Europe with trade goods, to West
Africa where slaves were purchased from local slave traders, to the Americas,
where the African slaves were sold. On 25 April 1837, Her Majesty’s Brigantine
Griffon seized one slave-ship, the brig Don Francisco, as a prize near the island
of Dominica. Once captured, the vessel was repaired and given the name James
Matthews.
The James Matthews left London for Fremantle on 28 March 1841 with a cargo
of 7 000 slates, farming implements, general cargo, 3 passengers and a crew
of 15. The vessel struck rocks after parting its anchor warp, and sank on 23
July 1841. One of the passengers, Henry de Burgh, left a comprehensive diary
covering the voyage to Australia and his later experiences on the land. Much of
the cargo belonged to de Burgh, who had been involved in the organization of
the enterprise in England and had an interest in the vessel.
Maritime archaeologists and volunteers under the archaeological direction of
the Department of Maritime Archaeology carried out four seasons of excavation
on the wreck site between 1974 and 1976. Preservation conditions were good on
the site and a significant amount of the hull and cargo remained. While research
into the ship’s rigging and cordage has been published, most of the research
and publication has concentrated on the hull, as an important representative of
the slave trade. Recently the wreck has been the subject of an in-situ preservation
study designed to ameliorate the effects of sand movement around the remains.
This work has been carried out with staff from the Department of Materials

In 1976 Mr Keen reported having found a square glass gin bottle and remains of a copper chest while surveying in 1968. In 1978 Scott Sledge WAM Wreck Inspecto heard stories of  a wreck at James Price Point from Richard Hunter of Brooome and Lucky Starr of Kuri Bay Pearls. Miscellaneous flotsam including wreckage from a lugger or smaller vessel, glass fragments and keyhole or latch fittings from a chest, door or suitcase. Timber samples of the rib and dinghy planks were found to be oregon. Sledge identified the materials as post-1900 and not definitely associated with a wreck, and the site is a flotsam trap. However the persistent oral histories suggest a lugger was wrecked in the vicinity. Richard Hunter also told a story that an early four-masted ship was wrecked on a rock near James Price Point and all of the survivors were speared as they came ashore, and that he had seen heavy chain on the seabed but not dived it.","","","","","","","","","Y","Y","-17.4955555","","","","122.1422221667","","","","","","","","","Not protected State","Sledge, S., Wreck Inspection Report, James Price Point relics, 23 July 1982, unpublished report, Department of Maritime Archaeology","","","","","1715","Wooden","","","Relic associated with ship","North West (Broome Area)"

It had a clinker plated hull, two decks, a round stern, one bulkhead and a demi figurehead of a man. It had a raised quarterdeck 4.3 m long, and a forecastle 5.8 m in length and had been cemented. The owners were Archibald Currie & Co. of Melbourne, who used it in trading between Melbourne and Calcutta. After discharging a cargo of jarrah sleepers which had been loaded at Rockingham, the barque departed Calcutta in late April 1878 for Melbourne. It was under the command of Captain R. Young, had a crew of First Mate Grimes, Second Mate David Foreman and seven Malays. It also had on board ten passengers. Seven of these passengers were from a theatrical party under the leadership of Mr J.W. Kelly. Named passengers were Mr & Mrs Cowdery (Mrs Cowdery had the stage name of Miss Bessie Edwards), Mr & Miss Williams, P.B. Smith, and W. Phillips. These were the only passengers whose names were listed in contemporary Melbourne and Perth newspapers.
The cargo consisted of 3 000 cases of castor oil, 1?000 bales of sack bags and 600 bales of jute.
In the Bay of Bengal the James Service was becalmed for sixteen days, during which Captain Young suffered serious sunstroke and became delirious and paranoid. As he was not capable of commanding the vessel, the first mate, Grimes, took command and sailed it to Penang in Malaya. In Penang the captain was charged with imperilling the vessel through his incompetence. The hearing upheld the charge but found that it was due to ill health, and he was therefore unfit to continue command. The ship’s agents then gave command to Captain Seivwright, and the James Service left for Melbourne on 7 June 1878. The route from Penang and around Cape Leeuwin should have kept the barque well offshore and clear of all dangers. A severe gale from the north-west had been blowing for some days prior to the wreck of the barque.
THE LOSS
The exact circumstances regarding the loss of the James Service are not known. On 23 July 1878 William Eacott reported to Constable Robert Holmes at Mandurah the sighting of a wreck west of the mouth of the Peel Inlet. Holmes later wrote to his superintendent:
I beg to report for the information of the Supt. of Police that William Eacott Junior reported in Mandurah on 23 inst. that a Vessel was on the South end of Murray reef and hearing this report I started at once for Mr. Hall’s hill where we saw with the glass a Vessel about 7 miles off foundered. I returned at once & despatched my Native to Pinjarrah with Telegrams. I then proceeded on the North Beach in company with Mr. C. Tuckey. When about three miles on the Beach we found a Boat on Shore marked on stem James Service Melbourne. She had one oar & one crutch in Board & Rudder & Painter gone—no sign of tracks whatever. We also found several cases of Passenger’s Luggage comprising clothing, books, etc. etc. apparently belonging to Theatrical Performers all now in charge of Mr. C. Tuckey by order of the Collector of Customs. The Beach is literally strewed with cases of castor oil.
I started this morning in company with P.C. Offer [John Offer] on the North Beach with the view of finding some Dead Bodys [sic]. We patrolled the beach for 14 miles without success. We found the remains of two or three Boats on shore and marked James Service Melbourne & several pieces wood marked the same. I will have the beach patrolled daily for some trace & report results as regular as possible.
Robert Holmes, P.C.
(Police Department General File 1878, quoted in Richards, 1978: 417)
As there were several vessels overdue the initial report caused some anxiety for their safety, but it soon became clear that this was not a local vessel. On 31 July the newspapers reported that ‘the hull appears to have been wrenched asunder by the shock caused by collidence with the rocks, and is lying detached in the wide crevices of the reef’ (Inquirer, 31 July 1878: 3d). Part of the James Service was still visible above water over two weeks after striking the reef. ‘A small part of her port bow with nameboard on was visible a short time since, but I fear that this westerly weather will put her out of sight altogether’ (Inquirer; 7 August 1878: 3d).
There were no survivors. Over a number of days, starting on 25 July, many bodies were found scattered along a 65 kilometre stretch of the coast. The first, identified as that of Mrs Towers, was taken to Fremantle, next to be found was Mrs Cowdery on 27 July, who was buried at Christ’s Church in Mandurah. Her husband’s body was not found until some time later and 48 km south of the Peel Inlet. He, along with what was presumed to be the mate’s body, a Malay crewman, and three more bodies found in early August, were also buried at Mandurah. Seven others were so decomposed that they were buried in the sand hills south of the Peel Inlet near where they were found.
In 1973 a skull found in some sand dunes was believed to be that of one of the victims who had been buried there. It is possible that the skull belonged to the body found by Constable Holmes 12 days after the wreck, about 6.5 km south of the Peel Inlet. He reported it to be ‘evidently a white man…male…5 ft. 8 in…dressed in a tweed suit…in a very decomposed state’ which he ‘buried next morning on the beach as I could not remove or yet coffin him…’ (Police report by Constable Holmes who was responsible for the identification, recording and interment of the bodies, a very difficult task as so many were badly decomposed and disfigured; quoted in WAM File MA 66/74).
INQUIRY
A diary, said to be in a woman’s handwriting, which washed ashore stated that for a few days prior to 20 July the vessel had experienced a period of very rough weather, being at one time on its beam ends with the yards touching the water. It was speculated in the press that the very strong north-west gale which had been blowing for some days had set the James Service on to the coast, and that it had struck the reef during the night, sinking before anything could be done to save lives (Inquirer, 31 July 1878).
INITIAL SALVAGE
Besides the bodies and flotsam noted above there were also trunks and packages bearing the names Miss Bessie Edwards, Royal Theatre, Calcutta; H. Williams; J.W. Reddie; and J. Steeler, together with thousands of tins of castor oil, cabin fittings, decking and other items. In November 1878 the wreck was sold at an auction for £20, and late in the year a diver examining the wreck reported that the hull had broken in two.
One of the boats from the James Service was acquired by the Tuckey family, rigged as a cutter and named Ellen.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the James Service lies at the southern end of Murray Reef on a bearing of 335º from Robert Point.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreckage from the James Service lies in 3–4 m of water and is scattered over an area approximately 55 m long by 12 m wide, with the main axis of the keel running about east-west, with the bow pointing west. While much of the plating has disappeared many of the frames are still clearly visible. The bow, canted to starboard, has collapsed but the bowsprit is still in place. The stern, which is in better condition, lies on a sandy bottom in 10 m of water, and rises to within 3 m of the surface. Part of the steering gear is visible, as are some of the masts, a winch and various ship’s fittings.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
Prior to 1976, when the wreck of the James Service was gazetted as an historic shipwreck, local divers recovered items from the wreck. An anchor raised in 1962 has been placed near the grave of some of the victims in the cemetery at Christ’s Church in Mandurah, together with a spider band from the mizen mast.
Over the years erosion of the coastal sand hills has uncovered skeletal remains of some of those victims buried close to where they were found. During the mid 1970s the remains of two individuals were recovered by the Western Australian Museum.
A 6.6 m section of the mizen mast from the James Service was given to the Mandurah Community Museum by the Western Australian Museum, Fremantle.","NO","Scotland","","1991/12","All","4.60","N","2009/0136/SG _MA-66/74","Y","Y","-32.458","","46.90","","115.6641666667","","","55609","Govan","Calcutta","Melbourne","Melbourne","GPS","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

  Jessie was built by W. Wray, Williamstown, Victoria with clinker planking, one deck, a straight stem and a round stern. The engine was built at Williamstown by George Laker or possibly Saker, and had a 14 in (35.56 cm) bore with a 14 in (35.56 cm) stroke, and was fed by a vertical boiler. Originally registered at Melbourne (No. 8/1886), the tug was sold to William Douglas of Albany during that year. Under the command of Captain McLaughton the steamer departed Melbourne for Albany on its delivery voyage on 18 September 1886. In July 1890 Douglas sold the tug to T. Place, also of Albany. On 5 November 1890 Place and another man were going out to the Jessie when the small boat they were in capsized. The two men were rescued by a boat from the schooner Ariel.  Place subsequently sold the tug to Armstrong & Waters on 29 April 1892. It was at this time that the Jessie was registered at Fremantle (No. 2/1892). On 1 April 1910 the Jessie broke its moorings in Princess Royal Harbour and drifted ashore, causing damage estimated at £1 500.
THE LOSS
Some time, probably in 1911, the Jessie was abandoned in the shallow water off Lawley Park in Princess Royal Harbour. Indications are that little was stripped off the vessel before it was abandoned, as Howard L. Hartman has stated that (initially at least) the engine and boiler were left on board. A photograph dated about 1912 in Marshall (2001: 179) shows the Jessie ashore with the funnel clearly visible, so at that time the boiler was still in place.
SITE LOCATION
The remains of the Jessie have now been covered by port development in Princess Royal Harbour below Lawley Park.","NO","Australia","","","","1.71","Single cylinder steam engine, 14 NHP","","N","N","","","18.60","","","","","88940","Williamstown, Victoria","","Fremantle","","Position from Shipwrecks Chart Albany","Unknown","Worsley P. & J.

The Jessie Edwards was a cutter, and was possibly built by Frederick Jones in Fremantle. Charles Edwards of Geraldton owned it, although it appears possible that Edwards may have shared ownership with Jones. Edwards was involved in the pearling industry at Shark Bay and the Jessie Edwards, which had only very recently been launched, was probably intended for use in that industry. This may have been its delivery voyage. Frederick Jones also built the cutter Annie Agnes.
THE LOSS
The Jessie Edwards sailed from Fremantle late in May 1883, bound for Shark Bay under the command of Richard Gryffid Johns. No news was heard of the cutter and by September it was assumed that it had been lost with all hands. Five months after it left Fremantle a wreck full of sand was discovered on the beach at the south end of Jurien Bay. This wreck was identified as the Jessie Edwards. It was split down the centreline and the mast was broken off.
INQUIRY
In October the boat builder Frederick Jones applied for a grant of £12 10s 0d to cover his costs in searching for survivors. The Harbour-Master was given authority to pay £12 ‘to the owners of Jessie Edwards to search for survivors’ (Telegram Col.

Köhler","Gale, cable parted","Y","9.80","","Jarrah","BA 1472F","Katinka was built under Special Survey by Macfadyen & Co. at Glasgow to Lloyd’s Special Survey A1 standard, and launched in August 1874 as the ship Ardenconnel, Official No. 67947. It had a raised quarterdeck 11 m long, one bulkhead and was cemented. The owner of the Ardenconnel in 1879 was J. Brymner & Co., and it was registered at Greenock. The vessel was converted to barque rig at some time between 1879 and 1893. By the early 1890s, the barque now known as Katinka was owned by J.D. Ahlers, and registered at Elsfleth. In 1900 the owner was C. Fesenfeldt, but the registration was still held at Elsfleth.
The Katinka had arrived from Reunion Island in late May, and had loaded a cargo of timber destined for South Africa from Maurice Coleman Davies’ mill. This cargo was insured with the Commercial Union Assurance Company. However three of the crew of fourteen deserted, and only one man having been caught, the master, W. Köhler, was obliged to go overland to Bunbury to find replacements for the two still missing. When he returned to Hamelin Bay he decided to remain ashore that night, intending to go on board the following morning. Also in the port loading timber were the barques Lövspring and Nor’wester.
THE LOSS
One of the most severe storms to hit the South-West occurred in July 1900. This storm occasioned much damage and caused the loss of three vessels and the stranding of a fourth in Hamelin Bay. There were two phases to the storm—the first phase with winds from the north-north-west on 22 July, and a second phase when winds swung round to the south-west the following day. The Katinka survived the first phase but was blown from its mooring during the second phase.
During the night when the storm struck, the captain being ashore, the mate, Elimar Menke, decided that it was too dangerous to lie alongside the jetty, so he took the Katinka to one of the moorings laid down by the timber company. He also set one of the vessel’s own anchors. Captain Köhler arrived at the jetty early the next morning, but it was too rough for him to be able to get aboard. During the day the wind and seas increased, and about 8.00 p.m. the wind was blowing at 85 knots (157 km per hour) as registered by the lighthouse keeper at Cape Leeuwin. He also recorded a barometric pressure of 28.86 inches (977.3 hPa).
Under these conditions the main anchor cable parted. The first mate and crew went to the forecastle in an attempt to secure another anchor to the cable, but before this could be achieved a wave broke over the barque, the crew taking to the rigging to save themselves. Able seaman Martin Augustsen was not quick enough and was swept overboard. The mate then ordered all hands to the stern, but only some made it there where they clung to the mizen mast rigging. The force of the wind was such that the Katinka dragged the timber company’s mooring, consisting of three anchors each over 2 tons in weight and over 200 fathoms (366 m) of chain cable, more than half a mile. ‘Nautical men will understand the force of weather necessary to do this’ (West Australian, 30 July 1900: 4i).
About midnight the first mate thought that the Katinka was breaking amidships, and advised those men with him on the mizen mast to jump and attempt to swim for the shore. Two men reached the shore but four, including the mate, drowned. One of those who reached the beach later died in Fremantle Hospital from internal injuries.
With the rest of the crew clinging to the foremast the vessel drifted northwards, where it struck about 450 m from shore. These men clung to the rigging until they were rescued the following morning by the Hamelin Bay harbour-master, John Delfs. He, with a crew consisting of L.C. Peterson, Carl Carlson, S. Neilson (all Scandinavians) and a local man, Frank Johnston, took one of the lifeboats from the Lövspring, and after anchoring upwind of the wrecked Katinka, floated a lifebuoy down on a line. They managed to pull the seven men one at a time to the boat.
The rescue was attended with great difficulty and danger, because the boat had to be inside the outer breakers, and it was hard work to keep her from broaching to (West Australian, 30 July 1900: 4i).
Because of the severity of the wind it took the rescue crew some three hours to pull the one mile (1.85 km) back to the safety of the jetty.
INQUIRY
There appears to have been no inquiry into the loss of the Katinka (most probably because it was foreign owned). Inquests into the deaths of Elimar Menke (first mate, of Oldenburg), Martin Augustsen (able seaman, of Sweden), Max Herrmann (able seaman, of Essen) and George Hamann (sail maker, of Hamburg), were held at the Police Station at Hamelin. The acting coroner was M.C. Davies, the foreman was Gaven Forrest McGregor, and the court was assisted by John Cunningham and James Donovan (Jr). The findings for Menke, Herrmann and Hamann were identical:
That the deceased came to his death by drowning through the stranding of the barque Katinka, and that no blame was attachable to anyone (West Australian, 9 August 1900: 5b).
The finding regarding Augustsen differed:
That the deceased came to his death through the stranding of the barque Katinka, whether from falling spars or drowning there is not sufficient evidence to show, and that no blame is attachable to anyone (ibid.).
There appears to have been no inquest held on Otto Neufeldt, the 14-year-old apprentice who was on his first voyage, possibly because his body was never recovered.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Lloyd’s surveyor, Captain Webster, arrived at Hamelin Bay from Fremantle on 26 July. The wreck of the Katinka was sold for £2 10s 0d at a public auction on 4 August 1900.
SITE LOCATION
The bow section of the wreck of the Katinka lies 150 m from the beach, about 1.2 km northwards of the base of the Hamelin Jetty.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The bow section of the Katinka, 17.6 m long, lies in 5.5 m of water, standing almost upright and lying on a north–south axis, parallel with the shore and with the iron bowsprit pointing south. A hole in the stem indicates where the vessel first struck. To seaward of this is a large windlass, while a small anchor lies inshore of the wreck. The stern section lies along the general axis of the wreck but with a slight twist towards the shoreline and is buried deeper in the sand bottom, although parts of it project up to 1.5 m above the sand. The midships section is almost completely covered with sand. It may be deduced from the Western Australian Museum Wreck Inspection Report, that although the vessel had broken its back the two sections still lie close together, indicating that they did not part as inferred by contemporary news reports.

THE VESSEL
The Kepler was built by Marcus Erling at Footscray, Victoria, with one deck, a straight stem and a square stern, and was rigged as a 3-masted schooner. The steam engine had been manufactured in 1885 by Matthew Paul & Son, Glasgow, and delivered 25 HP. This enabled the Kepler to steam a distance of 5 miles on 8 tons of coal. The first owner was J.J. White, and the vessel was registered at Melbourne. In 1880 it was bought by D. Munro & Co. Ltd, and sold to E. Walsh, T. May and W. Cowper in 1895. A subsequent purchaser in 1897 was Edward (or Edwin) Frank Millar who registered it at Fremantle (No. 4/1897). On 5 March 1909 it was purchased by The Adelaide Steamship Company Limited ‘for lighterage work in Western Australia’ (Register, 14 September 1909: 5d).
The Kepler was towed from Fremantle to Albany by the tug Uraidla, departing Fremantle on 26 March 1909. From there it was towed to Hopetoun by the steamer Ferret, arriving at 7.30 a.m. on 2 April. For the next 15 months the Kepler appears to have made fairly regular voyages between Albany and Hopetoun.
THE LOSS
In August 1910 an Albany newspaper reported on the sinking of the Kepler at Hopetoun:
The Adelaide Steamship Co.’s lighter Kepler sank at Hopetoun on Monday morning. She was fully laden with cargo brought by the steamer Ferret from Albany. The cargo included 50 tons of Government coal and considerable quantities of iron, kerosene, oil, tar, matches, and cyanide. A strong westerly gale was blowing at the time and the sea was very rough (Albany Advertiser, 13 August 1910: 2h).
At the time the Kepler was under the command of A.B. Pascall with a crew of three.
INITIAL SALVAGE
On 3 October 1910 the Kepler together with all the cargo on board was offered for sale at a public auction held in the Cleopatra Hotel, Fremantle. The cargo was said to comprise:
About 40 tons coal, 28 cases kerosene, 5 cases vestas [matches], 5 cases cyanide, 1 case nitric acid, 10 drums and cwt tar, quantity tram rails, bar iron, and steel (West Australian, 28 September 1910: 2g).
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
An anchor from the Kepler is on display at the Esperance Museum. It is iron stocked with short thick arms and wide flukes.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
The bulk of cargo which the Kepler was carrying was almost certainly destined for the goldfields. At this time Mary Ann Haven was an important port for the offloading of material used in the mining industry.

Non-propelled self elevating drilling unit (jack up barge), three triangular truss legs (108.8m length).
Four 25 ton S.W.L. deck mounted cranes, 18.2m diameter helipad on starboard side, accommodation for 95 persons in a four level accommodation block.
Double bottom, machinery deck with two longtitudinal bulkheads.
The jack-up drilling rig ‘Key Biscayne’ was last seen afloat shortly after
1845 hours W.A.S.T. Friday 1 September 1983 in position 31° 10' S, 115° 11' E,
10 nautical miles off Ledge Point on the coast of Western Australia. Shortly
before that time the tow line to the rig supply vessel ‘Atlas Van Diemen'
parted and the standby vessel ‘Argus Guard’, which had been stationed about
5 cables astern, pulled off to starboard to clear the rig as it was running
down with the weather. ‘Key Biscayne’ was clearly seen when about 2
cables off the port beam of the standby vessel both visually and by radar.
However, by the time ‘Argus Guard’ completed its turn, the rig was no
longer visible and radar contact had been lost.
‘Key Biscayne’ was on voyage under tow by two rig supply vessels ‘Lady
Sonia’ and ‘Atlas Van Diemen’ from a location off Darwin to Fremantle for
stacking in Cockburn Sound pending its future employment.
The loss of the rig was the combination of a series of events during the
final day when tow lines parted and gale force winds, rough seas and heavy
swells buffeted the rig. All 52 persons aboard ‘Key Biscayne’ were
evacuated by helicopter and were taken to nearby Lancelin township without loss or injury.
The tow line to ‘Lady Sonia’ parted at 0644 hours 1 September and for the
next twelve hours ‘Atlas Van Diemen' attempted to hold ‘Key Biscayne’ into
the weather and away from the lee shore. Concern for the safety of the
crew and of the rig was felt soon after the tow line to the supply vessel
‘Lady Sonia’ had parted. Shortly after 0900 hours the rig transmitted a
PAN message seeking assistance. By 0930 hours this message had been
converted into a MAYDAY and helicopter assistance was sought to evacuate
crew. At 1110 hours the first man was lifted from the helipad and by 1230
hours all non-essential personnel had been evacuated by both RAAF and
civilian helicopters. Throughout these operations the rig was wallowing in
the heavy seas and swells, rolling and pitching heavily.
During the day it was noticed that the vessel was settling by the stern
and listing to starboard, as heavy green seas were continually washing over
the main deck. The bow of the rig was seen lifting clear of the seas and
the stern immersed as the vessel pitched up to ten degrees forward and
about twenty five degrees by the stern. At the same time the rig was
rolling up to fifteen degrees each side of the upright.
All efforts to reconnect ‘Lady Sonia’ were unsuccessful. At about 1600
hours it was decided that the remaining crew should evacuate before dark
and return the next day when conditions were expected to moderate. The
drift of the rig toward the shore had been slowed by an anchor and the
weight on the tow line. With all line-throwing rockets spent and conditions
on deck too hazardous to work no useful purpose was seen in remaining on
board. By 1620 hours the remaining crew had been lifted from the rig.
The three support vessels remained in the area during the night. At about
0830 hours Friday 2 September ‘Argus Guard’ recovered a guitar case, life
jackets, paper and a trail of debris indicating the location of the sunken
rig.
The position of the wreck was confirmed by bathymetric survey
carried out on 8 and 9 September 1983.

THE LOSS
The Kia Ora was returning to Geraldton from Shark Bay when it struck a reef about 50 m offshore. The crewman on watch had apparently gone to sleep. Vincenzo Basile was the skipper and there were three crewmen plus a passenger, George McAvoy, a policeman on holiday. All of them escaped unharmed.

It had one deck and a round stern and was lightly built, with clinker plating possibly of Low Moor iron. By 1857 it was owned and registered at Hobart (4/1857), the owners being John Bogle (48 shares) and Richard J. McArthur (16 shares). Bogle was also in command of the barque during their ownership. It was sold to W. Patterson, also of Hobart, in June 1858. 
Described as a clipper barque, the Kingfisher was of very shallow draught. Advertised for sale at Geelong, Victoria, in January 1859, the draught was given as ‘when empty, 3 feet; when ballasted to sailing trim, 5 feet; when deeply laden, 8 feet’ (Argus, 3 January 1859: 1c). It sailed for Newcastle, NSW, on 17 January, returning on 31 January with a cargo of 227 tons of coal. It was again advertised for sale, and was stated to be ‘in first-rate order’ (Argus, 4 February 1859: 1). After another voyage to Newcastle under the command of W. Bartlett the barque was put up for auction at Lloyd’s Rooms, Collins Street, Melbourne. It was bought by the P&O Steam Navigation Company, and registered at Melbourne (No. 16/1859).
The next record is of the Kingfisher leaving Melbourne on 4 May 1859 for King George Sound with a cargo of coal. There must have been some delay, possibly due to weather, as the barque did not pass through Port Phillip Heads until six days later. The Kingfisher was heading ‘to Princess Royal Harbour…for ‘rigging down’ and use as a second coal hulk, supplementing the Larkins’ (Johnson, 1997: 66). It arrived in Albany on 1 June 1859, only five years after launching. Its short life as a trading barque was presumably due to its light construction. First used as a coal hulk, the official history of the P&O fleet states that in 1872 it was reduced to a lighter. 
In April 1883 the Kingfisher parted its mooring and became stranded on the west side of the jetty, but was later salvaged and moored at the western end of Princess Royal Harbour (see entry).
THE LOSS
A severe storm in 1905 drove the hulk Kingfisher to where the wreck currently lies. By this time the lightly built barque had outlived its useful life, and was abandoned.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the hulk Kingfisher lies south of Melville Point at the western end of Princess Royal Harbour.
SITE DESCRIPTION
In April 1992 a wreck inspection of the Kingfisher was carried out by Dr Michael McCarthy of the Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum. The wreck of the Kingfisher lies upright in shallow water with the lower section of the hull, which lies on an east/west axis, buried in the sandy bottom. Almost all the hull above the high water mark has either disintegrated or collapsed. The wreck is 120 feet (36.6 m) long and 18 feet (5.6 m) wide, and the most prominent feature is the stern post, although there are some frames and the stem post also visible. The iron is covered in marine growth. There remains under the sand a considerable portion of the wooden ceiling in a good state of preservation. A winch is visible in front of the wreck.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
During a July 1991 wreck inspection by Patrick Baker, Maritime Archaeology Department, Western Australian Museum, some samples of timber were collected.
The Kingfisher was the second coal hulk to be stationed at Albany.

Then sunk in storm off Cape Leeuwin","N","9.00","","Passengers/timber",""," Kitty Coburn was built in the state of Maine in the United States, of oak, pine, pitch pine and hackmatack, and had two decks. At the time of this incident the vessel’s owners were John C. Smith and Joseph Ware of Melbourne (registered Melbourne 40/1874), and it was under the command of Captain W. Steele. After calling at Augusta the Kitty Coburn had gone on to Albany to collect eleven passengers (seven adults and four children) before returning to Augusta to take on a cargo of timber destined for Adelaide. This timber was from William Eldridge’s mill, and he was running late on the delivery date. Eldridge had been granted a fourteen-year lease over 75 000 acres of timber in July 1875. His cargo was not insured.
THE LOSS
Part of the cargo of jarrah, some 130 loads, had been taken on board when, on the evening of 3 December 1875, a strong south-east gale struck the Kitty Coburn, causing the hawse pipes to be ripped out and the cables of both anchors to part, and the vessel went aground near the mouth of the Blackwood River. It was considered to be a total wreck.
The Admiralty surveyor, W.E. Archdeacon, visited the bay in 1877, but his warning published in the sailing directions less than two years later came too late for the Kitty Coburn:
Flinders bay being exposed to the south-east, from which quarter strong gales blow during the summer, sending in a heavy ground swell, should not be entered at that season…(Archdeacon, 1879:46).
INQUIRY
A Court of Inquiry into the loss of the Kitty Coburn was held at Augusta on 12 December 1875 by the Resident Magistrate from Vasse, but the finding is not known.
INITIAL SALVAGE
On 9 December 1875 Captain Steele reported to the police that two days previously a number of items had been stolen from the wreck of the Kitty Coburn. These included a drum of paint, cask of colza oil (now called canola oil), boat sail, glass bookcase, bolt of canvas and a marble table.
On 6 January 1876 the wreck of the Kitty Coburn was sold by auction held at Mewers Hotel, Busselton, for £270 to a consortium of Fremantle business men. One of the buyers, William Owston, was a shipwright, a master mariner and, at one time, Lloyd’s surveyor in Fremantle. Owston examined the wreck and considered that it was possible to salvage the vessel, repairing it sufficiently for it to be taken to Fremantle for a complete repair and refit. A party of men under the supervision of W. Brown, with all the necessary gear, was therefore sent to Augusta on board the 48-ton schooner Brothers to undertake this task.
After discharging the timber, eleven months later they eventually succeeded in refloating the Kitty Coburn. On 1 November 1876, using an easterly breeze, Brown sailed in company with the Brothers for Fremantle. The following day a gale from the north-west struck the vessels off Cape Leeuwin and the pumps on board the Kitty Coburn, which had been adequate until then, could not cope. The sixteen crewmen abandoned the vessel at 4.00 a.m., being picked up with great difficulty by the Brothers. This schooner then attempted to make Fremantle, but the weather was so severe and since it was short of provisions and water for so many men, it turned and ran before the gale to Albany.
The Fremantle business men suffered a heavy loss. ‘It is estimated that the loss by the owners, including purchase money, will be about £1 400’ (Herald, 11 November 1876: 3d). The gear which had been used in the salvage of the Kitty Coburn, including a diving dress, anchors and chains, was on board the vessel when it sank.","NO","USA","","","","5.10","N","195/72","N","N","","","38.10","","","","","64797","Damariscotta","Augusta","Melbourne","Fremantle","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., (2012).

"Koolama I","13941","Wyndham","Harland and Wolff Ltd","Western Australian State Shipping Service","Captain Jack Eggleston","Earlier bombed off Cape Rulhieres by 4 engine Japanese bombers in Joseph Bonaparte Gulf on 1942/02/20. 1942/03/03 attacked at Wyndham jetty and rolled on side, a total wreck.","Y","17.00","","","1047, 32","On 20 February 1942 the Koolama was attacked by Japanese bombers off Cape Ruilhieres, approximately 150 kilometres west of Wyndham while carrying 91 passengers, 89 crew and a cargo of war supplies destined for the Australian Army at Wyndham. It was the first aerial attack by the Japanese in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. The Japanese flew a total of 22 air attacks in the Kimberley region from bases in Timor between 20 February 1942 and July 1944, including five raids on Broome that destroyed 23 aircraft and resulted in the loss of some 100 lives.
The Koolama was damaged in the attack and though partially disabled, was able to be beached nearby in what is now known as Koolama Bay. Fortunately no lives were lost though some passengers and crew were wounded in the attack. The Koolama was bombed again the next day, but was able to send radio SOS signals. However the bombing of Darwin by the Japanese on 19 February delayed an official rescue response to this remote area.
Meanwhile the 180 passengers and crew were landed among the mangroves at Pangali Cove, where the local Kwini people found them and sent messages via runners between Pago Mission and the survivors’ camp, separated by 80 kilometres of rough country . The Pago Mission lugger arrived on 24 February and took away the sick, wounded, women and an infant with his parents a few days after the bombing. A seaplane arrived on 3 March and was able to evacuate a further 25 survivors. The remaining 93 survivors walked to Pago Mission guided by Kwini people. During this stage two Kwini men risked their lives to cross the flooding Drysdale River, run to Pago Mission and return with a rope to help the survivors across (Balanggarra Native Title Working Group).
With the large number of extra people stretching resources at Pago Mission the decision was made to walk everyone another 30 kilometres to the airstrip at Kalumburu Mission for evacuation, during which time one crew member died of heatstroke. Most of the passengers and crew arrived at Fremantle on 8 April, 47 days after the initial attack. Father Seraphim Sanz of Kalumburu Mission won laurels for his part in rescuing the stranded passengers and crew of the Koolama and bringing them to the mission in the Mission’s lugger Moa. 
Meanwhile a skeleton crew stayed aboard the Koolama and after patching the hull and pumping out water  on 1 March the Koolama was refloated and able to limp to Wyndham, where it arrived without steering and taking on water. Another Japanese attack on 3 March forced all hands to abandon ship and the Koolama was bombed and sunk at Wyndham wharf.
This was a double blow as not only had a vital link between the northern and southern part of Western Australia been lost, but a strategically important waterway and port had been partially blocked causing disruption to shipping and supply of war materials.
Difficult environmental conditions including strong tidal currents meant that the Koolama was never fully salvaged. A major salvage effort using over a hundred men (including helmet divers from Australia and India), plant and gear in 1946 succeeded in cutting holes in the ship’s hull and pumping in compressed air, with the aim of raising the hull keel up and towing it several kilometres away from the wharf or out to sea to be scuttled. However this attempt only succeeded in moving the wreck 47 feet further out from the wharf and depositing it across the natural tidal flow of the Cambridge Gulf. The Koolama remains in this position today with the hull and part of its war cargo (mainly foodstuffs) intact. A multi-beam survey by the Department of Transport conducted in 2010 shows the wreck lying on its starboard side with the port side almost totally exposed and intact for the entire length of the hull, and the starboard side buried. The hull comes to within 3.7 m of the surface at lowest astronomical tide (LAT). An unexploded Japanese bomb is believed to still lie within the wreck (Loane 1992: 1)
Statement of significance
The wreck of the MV Koolama has historic and social significance for its role as a State ship transporting passengers and cargo between Fremantle and the north-west ports of Western Australia between 1938-1942.
The Koolama has historic significance as a World War II site, indicating the impact of World War II in north-west Western Australia and the strategic significance of shipping and the north-west port of Wyndham. It is also the site of the first aerial attack by Japanese forces in the Kimberley area.
The MV Koolama stranding site and survivor camp at Koolama Bay and Pangali Cove is significant to the Kwini people who helped the 180 passengers and crew reach safety.","NO","Scotland","90","","","6.00","Twin diesel engines made by Bermister and Wain, 808 nhp","2009/0142/SG _MA-10/96","Y","N","-15.4497833333","","106.00","106.00","128.1010666667","","4.00","140184","Glasgow","Fremantle","Fremantle","Darwin","Aerial GIS","Not protected State","Loane, Bill, 1992, The Koolama Incident, CDC Graphics, Perth.

In October 1887 when it sailed from La Grange Bay to Cossack, the 28 year old brig Lady Denison (Official Number 41091), was described as `a great heavy vessel, very ancient, looking as if she had been built about the time of Noah, and not repaired or painted since’. From an account of this voyage published in February of the following year, it seems that the Lady Denison encountered very heavy weather and, at one stage of the journey, was `creaking and straining frightfully’. Nevertheless, the brig arrived safely at its destination on 27 October and was still apparently in reasonable condition on 15 November when it was sold, together with the schooner Harriet, the two vessels bringing a combined return of £157.3 Within the month, however, it seems that the brig had been sunk in Cossack creek, and by 9 December, it was said to be breaking up.

THE VESSEL
The Lady Lyttleton was originally built as the Sultan and had one deck and a full female figurehead. To date endeavours to find when and where it was built have proved unsuccessful. It was registered at Sydney in 1861 (No. 40/1861), the owners being Alex Young and John Howard, and was then stated as being ‘foreign built’. It was sold to Harold Selwyn Smith of Melbourne in 1866, and registered at that port (No. 13/1866). In 1867 the barque was under the command of Captain John McArthur with a crew of ten, and was sailing from Melbourne for Fremantle, calling at Warrnambool and Adelaide en route. Part of the cargo consisted of 224 bags of barley from Melbourne and 1 410 bags of potatoes from Warrnambool to be offloaded at Adelaide. However the bulk of the cargo was destined for Fremantle.
The Lady Lyttleton departed Adelaide on 29 May with three passengers, Mrs Hogan and Mr and Mrs Carmody, plus a very mixed cargo. This included, amongst other items, two bales of paper, kegs of tobacco, stationery, hardware, drapery, dried fruit, oatmeal, saddlery, 18 tons bran, 10 tons pollard, 443 tons of barley, barrels of pork which had been loaded at Adelaide, plus the remainder of the cargo which had been loaded at Melbourne. Also included were 10 cases of ‘oilmen’s stores’ consigned to prominent Fremantle businessman Elias Solomon.
On 16 June 1867 the Lady Lyttleton sailed into King George Sound leaking badly. One report states that it had also been dismasted (Perth Gazette, 5 July 1867: 2c). Part of the cargo had been jettisoned prior to the Lady Lyttleton arriving at Albany. The bulk of this jettisoned cargo consisted of flour. Having removed the remainder of the cargo (most of which was damaged), the barque was taken to Emu Point to be hove down for examination and repairs made to the underwater section of the hull. (See Appendix on Careening.)
THE LOSS
The Lady Lyttleton was hove down by tackles from the mastheads to the shore. Somehow the vessel slipped, and, being unable to return to an upright position because of the tackles on the masts, it filled and sank. There is no indication of exactly when this occurred but it was probably about 17 July 1867. As late as January 1927 it was reported that ‘her stem and stern posts can still be seen on the east bank of the Emu Point channel’ (Western Mail, 27 January 1927: 14a).
INITIAL SALVAGE
The cargo which had survived aboard the Lady Lyttleton had been subsequently off loaded on its arrival at Albany. Part of this, consisting of 537 bars of iron, 98 bundles of iron, 60 axles, and general merchandise consisting of 72 boxes, 400 cases plus various bales and packages. This was subsequently shipped to Fremantle on the Emily Smith (142 tons, Captain W. Davidson), arriving on 16 August 1867. A further shipment of 41 packages of merchandise, 20 cases of geneva [gin] and 30 packages of tobacco arrived at Fremantle on board the Midas two months later.
The following year the Albany Police Station ocurences book had the following entry:
28 June 1868. Sub-inspector Finlay and PC Foley started for Oyster Harbour, it having been reported that a quantity of wreckage had drifted ashore in various places on to that part of the coast from the ship Lady Lyttleton, which sank there about June 1867. PCs Rafferty and Hayman started by boat to join up with the other party at the wreck site (quoted in Dickson, 2012: 60).
The following day the entry noted their return:
29 August 1868. The search parties return from the wreck at Oyster Harbour. They found 2 dishes, 1 canteen, 2 coils of rope, some blocks, 23 tins of blacklead, 1 pair of can hooks, 1 drag chain and 2 marlin spikes. These items had been taken from the wreck of the Lady Lyttleton and not found on the shore as reported (ibid.).
The figurehead of the Lady Lyttleton was purchased by Campbell Taylor. It and the figurehead from the hulk Larkins, which he also bought, were taken to his farm at Candyup.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Lady Lyttleton lies off the north-east point of the channel leading in to Oyster Harbour.
SITE DESCRIPTION
A section of the hull of the Lady Lyttleton lies buried in the sand in 7-13 m of water about 15 m off the shore. The keelson, frames and planking have been excavated. The wreck lies with the keelson parallel with the shore, and the bow pointing northwards. A large windlass is near the bow and a corroded iron tank (probably a water tank) lies some 2-3 m aft of this. Nearby are two large trypots lying on their side, with a third trypot lying upright deeper in the channel. A corroded iron drum and a fragile wooden spar are also visible.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
On 25 September 1868 Sub-Inspector William Finlay of Albany reported to his superintendent that on 29 August he had recovered from the wreck of the Lady Lyttleton:
2 coils rope, 3 paint brushes, ½ tin black paint, 2 marlin spikes, 1 pr can hooks & drag chain, 2 dishes (earthen), 1 plate (do), 2 mugs (do), & 1 old block (SRO Acc 129, File 12/416).
He wished to know what to do with the items. The receiver of wrecks, Worsley Clifton, wrote a reply on 9 October 1868 stating that the items must be handed to the nearest sub-collector of customs. He went on to state:
If claimed by a lawful owner I can dispose of the case at once and if unclaimed they must remain twelve months and a day in my hands before they can be sold.
The salvor is entitled to one third their price under any circumstances as well as any legitimate expenses in handing them to the proper officer.
The Merchant Shipping Act is very clear on these questions and I enclose an extract from my instructions on the subject (SRO Acc 129, File 12/416).
In 1961 local divers recovered some artefacts including an anchor, the rudder and pintles and an extremely corroded sextant. These items are now in the Western Australian Museum, although prior to their acquisition by the Museum part of the rudder was sawn off. This piece was used to make a bench now at the Spencer Park School. A Western Australian Museum excavation in 1978 recovered a number of other items including a pair of nested iron pots, part of a slate log, some Muntz metal sheathing and a pulley sheave.
In 1990 two students of the Graduate Diploma of Maritime Archaeology course, Tom Vosmer and Jim Wright, carried out further excavations and research on the Lady Lyttleton in an endeavour to find when and where it was built. They took 17 timber samples, and samples of ballast stone, coal, possible caulking material, a square-section copper alloys spike, a coin and the remains of a pair of shoes. The timber samples proved to be mainly oak and pitch pine, northern hemisphere timbers found in both Europe and America. A coin recovered at this time was identified as a Chilean medio centavo, or half cent, dated 1853.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
TECHNICAL (2)
Despite the number of timber samples taken and subsequently analysed, and a close perusal of available records, the date and place of building of the Sultan later renamed Lady Lyttleton remains a mystery. Further research may resolve this problem.

Coastal search widened
PERTH: A search for six fishermen lost at sea off the north-west coast of Western Australia since last Friday has been widened. Karratha police said yesterday the search of waters off the coast of Onslow, 1386km north of Perth, had been extended to include nearby Barrow Island.
Three fixed-wing aircraft, a helicopter and a number of boats are involved. The six missing men were on the fishing boats Harmony and Lady Pamela
when they were caught in fierce seas as Cyclone Bobby
battered the town of Onslow on Friday night. The wrecked hulls of both
vessels were found about 10 nautical miles north of Onslow at the weekend, and the body of a woman, believed to be Janine Callow, 26, of Mudgee, in central NSW, was found on the Harmony three days ago.
The body was flown to Perth on Thursday for an autopsy and identification
by dental records.

Mörck","Struck reef","N","9.50","","721 tons of timber","334, 756","  Langstone was built under Special Survey by W. Pile & Co., and had one deck, one bulkhead, two tiers of beams and was cemented. It had a forecastle with a length of 7.32 m and a quarterdeck 13.72 m long. In 1882 at the time of the merger between the Shaw, Savill line and the Albion line the barque was valued at £10 444. Originally named Langstone when owned by Shaw, Savill and Albion Co. Ltd, later references spell the name as Langston, possibly as the result of its subsequent sale to Norwegian owners. The West Australian described it as ‘one of the prettiest models that ever floated in the waters of Koombana Bay’ (West Australian, 12 February, 1902, 7f). The owner of the barque was C.B. Mörck, who was also the master, and this was his first visit to Australia. It had arrived from Madagascar on 7 December 1901, with a crew of thirteen. The Langston was ready to sail on Friday 7 February, having loaded a cargo of 721 loads of timber from Millars’ Karri and Jarrah Forest, Limited, but the master delayed his departure due to the age-old sailors’ belief that to sail on a Friday was unlucky. The barque and its cargo with a total value of £4 000 were fully covered by insurance.
THE LOSS
The Langston departed Bunbury at 6.30 a.m. on Saturday, 8 February, 1902. The morning was fine with a breeze from the south-south-east. However at noon it commenced blowing a gale from south-south-west to south-west with a heavy cross sea running. The first mate, Carl Sunbye, later told a reporter: ‘When off Cape Naturaliste some 15 miles the captain gave instructions to lie out to windward—that is westerly—so to be well clear of the reefs’ (West Australian, 12 February, 1902, 7f). According to evidence given by the mate the barque was sailing at eight knots on a course of N.W.½W.
Captain Mörck had been watching out for the Naturaliste Reef, which he anticipated should be awash, but:
…with the heavy breaking of the seas all round made it impossible for me to detect the break on the reef. About 2 o’clock in the afternoon I suddenly picked up the reef right in front, and at once attempted to luff, but it was too late, and the next moment we went crashing over the rocks, which I am satisfied formed a portion of the Naturaliste Reef, the Cape bearing S.S.W. about 24 miles.
The ship at once commenced to go down, and when, on sounding the hold, I found that she had made nine feet of water in a few minutes, I gave the order to clear away the boats (statement by Captain Mörck quoted in Bunbury Herald, 13 February 1902: 2e).
In fact according to the first mate the Langston struck three times. It then listed over with seas breaking over the bulwarks, and slipped off the rocks. Captain Mörck said that this saved them, for they could not have manned a boat while on the reef, it being too rough. Three boats were lowered but one immediately filled with water and because of the rough seas it could not be bailed out. The second mate, Johann Weiseth, and seven of the crew got into the lifeboat, and the captain, first mate, steward, carpenter and a seaman went in a smaller boat, referred to in a newspaper report as a praam. This would have been a small lightly-built dinghy normally used only in harbour.
The Langston lay for a minute or so with the keel vertical, bow down and only the poop, mizen mast and part of the keel visible, before slipping beneath the waves into deep water. From the time it struck to the time the boats were lowered was ten minutes, and it sank only ten minutes after that in 23 fathoms (42 m) of water.
The southerly direction of the gale force wind and the consequent beam seas forced the boats away from a course for Bunbury, obliging them to run more northerly. The wind was too strong for any sail to be set, and the crew used the oars to keep the boats heading before the seas. The lifeboat took the smaller praam in tow, and, running before the strong wind both craft had great difficulty in staying afloat, the crews having to constantly bail.
That night one of the seamen, Andreas Ingrald (or Ingraid) Larsen, dropped his oar and fell exhausted into the bottom of the lifeboat. He was raving incoherently, and tore off some of his clothing. The captain delegated one of the crew to try to keep Larsen’s head above the water swilling around in the bottom of the boat. Larsen, aged 22, had been shipwrecked only a short while previously, and had been picked up by the Langston at Trama Tave in Madagascar just before it departed for Bunbury.
On Sunday morning those in the praam transferred to the far more seaworthy lifeboat, and the small dinghy was let go about 16 miles (30 km) from land. The planks of the lifeboat had dried and shrunk during the vessel’s stay in Bunbury and it therefore leaked very badly. This gives an indication of the danger which had been faced by the men in the even more unseaworthy praam. With two men bailing continuously they managed to set a small sail about noon, and sighted land about 4.00 p.m. that afternoon. The boat reached the shore some 30 miles north of Bunbury near Lake Preston at around 5.00 p.m.
About a kilometre from the beach the survivors found the home of Mr and Mrs Salter. This couple took them in and gave them shelter for the night. The following day, Monday 10 February, the captain and some of the crew were taken to Bunbury by another settler, Arthur Jones, in his buggy. Here they reported the wreck to the Resident Magistrate, W.H. Timperley, at 10.00 p.m. that night. The reminder of the crew arrived in Bunbury around midnight.
There are some discrepancies regarding exactly when Larsen died and what happened to his body after the survivors reached shore. The captain said that on Sunday ‘at 3 p.m. Larsen, who had not recovered his reason, expired’ (Bunbury Herald, 13 February 1902: 2e). However according to the mate, when they reached the shore at 5.00 p.m. Larsen was still alive, but only just, and had died that night on the beach. Both agree that Larsen was wrapped in a sail while he lay on the beach. Captain Mörck then claimed that when he was taken to Bunbury by Jones, he took with him Larsen’s body, handing it over to the police on Monday night. It was then placed in the morgue. This was hotly disputed by the local press:
The captain’s statement in regard to bringing the body of the unfortunate man Larsen into Bunbury is flagrantly inaccurate. The man’s body was left on the beach for a considerable time, as a matter of fact until it was removed on Tuesday morning. The body only reached Bunbury on Tuesday at midnight, and when it was taken to the morgue it was in a very advanced state of decomposition. Larsen’s body lay on the beach at Lake Preston from Sunday afternoon until Tuesday morning, when it was removed and brought into town by P.C. Nesbit and Mr. Jones, a settler at Lake Preston, arriving at the morgue about midnight Tuesday (Bunbury Herald, 13 February 1902: 2e).
Doctor Williams examined Larsen’s body and concluded that he had drowned. This presumably had occurred while Larsen lay in the water in the bottom of the lifeboat. The inquest held on 12 February at the Bunbury Courthouse by the Resident Magistrate, with a jury consisting of J.G. Baldock, Harry Brashaw and Arthur Charles Cook came to a similar conclusion, their verdict being that the ‘deceased came to his death by drowning while in the state of unconsciousness and that no blame could be attached to any person’ (Bunbury Herald, 13 February 1902: 2e-g).
INQUIRY
As the Langston was a foreign owned vessel there was no official investigation into the wrecking, but a consular inquiry was to be held. As reported above, a coroner’s inquest was held on the death of Johann Larsen.
SITE LOCATION
Some of the newspaper reports initially caused confusion over the location of the wreck. The West Australian (12 February 1902: 7f-g) stated that Captain Mörke estimated its position as being about 85 miles south-south-west of Bunbury. This places it some 16 miles (30 km) south-south-west of Cape Leeuwin in 75 fathoms (137 m) of water, and is obviously incorrect. The boats running before the southerly wind after the sinking of the Langston would not, from that position, have fetched up on the beach opposite Lake Preston in the time of 27 hours. Another sentence in that report places the wreck at 25 miles south-west of Cape Naturaliste. This would appear to be confirmed by the telegram sent by the Resident Magistrate to the Collector of Customs in Fremantle:
Captain Morck, of the Norwegian barque Langston, loaded with timber, bound from Bunbury to London, reports at 10 p.m., that his ship, which left Bunbury on Saturday, 8th instant, struck an unknown reef bearing south south-west of Cape Naturaliste at 2 p.m. on same date. Twenty-five miles from land she went down in deep water. Thirteen of the crew, including the captain, got in the boats with great difficulty, and reached Lake Preston, thirty miles from Bunbury, at 5 p.m. on Sunday, the 9th instant. One man, Andreas Ingraid Larsen, died from exhaustion. I am arranging hold inquest. Captain proceeding to Fremantle to report to Norwegian Consul (quoted in Bunbury Herald, 11 February 1902: 2f).
There is obviously an error made by the Resident Magistrate as Cape Naturaliste lies about 19 nautical miles south of Naturaliste Reef, not vice versa as stated in the telegram, and Captain Mörck was quite sure that it was on that reef that his vessel had struck.
The second mate, Johann Weiseth, stated that it occurred about a mile west of the Naturaliste Reefs. This does not seem probable as there is nothing but deep water west of that reef. The Government Gazette of 16 April 1841 warned mariners that:
Naturaliste Reef appears to lie 16 or 17 miles N. by E. by compass from the extremity of Cape Naturaliste.
The soundings are no indication of its vicinity, the average depth being 25 to 30 fathoms between the Reef and the Cape, and 25 fathoms 5 or 6 miles to the westward. At one mile North, the depth is 13 fathoms.
The Admiralty Pilot written 118 years later repeats the warning that taking soundings is of no use in ascertaining the position of the reef:
Naturaliste reefs, on which the sea does not always break, lie about 30 miles westward of Casuarina point, and consists of two patches, nearly awash, 7 cables apart. The northern patch is steep-to on its western side, against which the sea, striking in bad weather, is thrown to a considerable height. The soundings give no warning in approaching these reefs as there are depths of from 20 to 23 fathoms (36m6 to 42m1) one cable distant (Admiralty Pilot Vol. V, 1959: 410).
It seems most probable that the Langston struck the southern section of the reef, and that Weiseth saw the waves breaking against the northern reef which was seven cables (1?418 m) from him, and in a north-easterly direction. The strong wind blowing at the time would have caused seas to be ‘thrown to a considerable height’ as described in the Pilot. In the urgent haste to abandon ship the exact direction of the waves breaking on the reef would have been of minor importance.
This reef is most probably the one sighted by Nicolas Baudin on board the Géographe on the morning of 10 March 1803: ‘…a fairly long line of rocks over which the sea was breaking heavily. At six o’clock we made out three of them that seemed to form a triangle from North to South’ (Baudin, 1974: 500). The reef had been previously sighted in 1801 by the look outs of the Naturaliste, but when the commander, Jacques Felix Emmanuel Hamelin, had climbed to the topgallant yard and not seen anything their sighting was not believed.
It is of interest to note that Wickham and Stokes when leaving Koombana Bay on the Beagle in late December 1841 passed close to Naturaliste Reef but, presumably because there was little or no swell, it was not actually sighted:
The course we held led us within five miles of the north side of Naturaliste Reef, in 29 fathoms; the depth we found sixteen miles west of it was 60 fathoms, and half a mile south of it 26 fathoms. It partakes of the error in latitude previously discovered in Cape Naturaliste, which is distant sixteen miles, and bears, when over the centre of it, S2½ºW. (true.) (Stokes, 1846: 397).
Naturaliste Reef, that is laid down 15 or 18 miles north from the cape of the same name, was not seen from the Beagle (Wickham & Stokes, 1842: 140–41).
Note: The Australia Pilot, Volume 5 (1972: 181), gives the position of the reef as 19 miles north of Cape Naturaliste.","NO","UK","13","","1","6.00","N","112/80","N","N","","","56.80","","","","","60950","Sunderland","Bunbury","Fredrikstad, Norway","London","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

THE VESSEL
The Larkins was built of teak by Hudson, Bacon and Co. in Calcutta and launched as the Louisa. Copper fastened and sheathed, it was ship-rigged with two decks, a poop, a square stern and quarter galleries. The height between decks was 6.5 feet (1.98 m), which was unusually generous for those times. Armed with 12 guns, it carried a crew of 50 men. It was built on speculation and then sailed to England.
In 1809 the Louisa was bought by John Pascall Larkins. He renamed it Larkins after a nephew, Captain Thomas Larkins, who was in command of the Honourable East India Company’s ship Warren Hastings when it fought a gallant but hopeless action against the 50-gun French frigate La Piemontaise in February 1805. It would probably have been in 1809 that a male warrior figurehead was carved and fitted. Larkins chartered the Larkins to the Honourable East India Company, and it made its first voyage to the east (Bengal and Penang) departing on 9 June 1810. It subsequently made many voyages under charter to that company. In 1822 the ship was sold to a relative, W. Larkins, who also chartered it to the Honourable East India Company.
The Larkins made three voyages to Australia in 1817, 1829 and 1831 as a convict transport. The latter two were under new ownership as the Larkins had been sold to Joseph Somes of London in 1827. In 1837 it was again sold, this time to Ingram and Co., also of London. In 1842 that firm sold the ship to Haviside and Co., who, in January 1853, sold it to the Peninsular and Orient Steam Navigation Company. They bought the ship for use as a coal hulk to be based at their coaling depot at Albany.
On 24 March 1853 the Larkins, under the command of Captain Hederstedt, first mate H.M. Thomas, and a crew of 41, sailed from Blackwall on the River Thames for Albany with a cargo of 1 000 tons of coal and stores plus 15 cabin and five steerage passengers, arriving on 11 July. On arrival the ship was moored in Princess Royal Harbour and stripped to a hulk, which also involved the removal of the upper masts. The first of the many coal hulks in Albany, it was moored using chain fore and aft some 400 m out from the company’s depot on the shore below Lawley Park. In early 1855 when P&O ceased its steamer service from Singapore to Sydney, the Larkins was left idling at anchor.
With the end of the Crimean War tenders for the mail service to Australia were sought. The P&O tender was beaten by that from the European and Columbian Steam Navigation Company, which then changed its name to European and Australian Royal Mail Co. Ltd. The Larkins, along with P&O’s stock of coal was sold to that company in 1857. The following year the European and Australian Royal Mail Co. Ltd collapsed, the Admiralty once more called for tenders for the mail service, and P&O were the successful bidders. Larkins then reverted back to their ownership. Over the next 18 years the hulk gradually deteriorated. On a number of occasions the harbour-master, Captain George T. Butcher, reported unfavourably on the decayed state of the ship’s old timbers. After a survey by captains Butcher, J.G. Lapham (American whaling barque Canton), Smith (brig Obelia) and P&O’s shipwright J.W. Howe, the Larkins was cut down to only one deck, and some other repairs were also carried out.
THE LOSS
The Larkins was sold for demolition on 8 September 1876, and supposedly broken up on the shore near the P&O coaling depot. At that time the harbour master at Albany was anxious that nothing remained of the old East Indiaman, and instructed:
…every portion of her must be removed above high water mark at as early date as possible (quoted in Wolfe, 1998).
However, a Public Works Department plan dated 1897 shows the abandoned P&O coaling jetty with a wreck, burnt to the waterline, marked in a position immediately west of the jetty. This may possibly be the remains of the Larkins.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The sale of the Larkins for demolition is said to have made a profit of £1 014 for P&O. It is not known who purchased the hulk, but when it was broken up some of the teak timber was used by a resident of Albany as house flooring. When the house was later demolished some of this teak was sold to the well-known yachtsman Rolly Tasker, and used in the construction of one of his yachts.
The figurehead from the Larkins, the oldest in Australia, is on display at the Albany Residency Museum.
SITE LOCATION
There is no visible evidence of the Larkins. The area where it was supposedly broken up has been substantially altered by modern harbour development.
In 1998 Adam Wolfe carried out very detailed research resulting in the location of the timber remains of a vessel now covered by reclaimed land within the Albany Port Authority grounds. This position coincides with the wreck marked on the 1897 PWD plan. Test holes produced timber samples which were analysed by Dr Ian Godfrey of the Department of Materials Conservation, Western Australian Museum. The various samples were of a number of different timbers including beech, white oak, jarrah and a hard pine of the pitch pine family. Pitch pine is indigenous to a number of countries, including India. The Larkins underwent many repairs over its very long life, none known to have been carried out in India. The replacement timbers would therefore have been European, North American, and Western Australian timbers.
It is quite possible that, despite Captain Butcher’s instructions, much of the lower part of the hull of the Larkins was not broken up, but remained to be later covered in harbour expansions.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The site of the wreck that may be the remains of the Larkins lies under many feet of land fill, bows towards the sea. There is currently no indication of how much of the vessel is buried.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
The timber samples taken by Adam Wolfe are currently the only clue as to the identity of this wreck.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
The Larkins is a tangible link with the Honourable East India Company, one of the most powerful companies in the world during the 18th and 19th centuries.
The Larkins was used to announce to the town the arrival of an incoming ship. The keeper of the lighthouse on Breaksea Island was the first to see arriving ships, and used a flagstaff with crossbar to signal the arrival. This signal would be repeated on the Larkins, which would also fire a 6-pounder cannon or, if it was at night, fire a blue flare and a rocket to alert the town. If the vessel was a P&O steamer, two bullocks were killed to provide fresh meat. Any meat left over after the visiting ship had filled its requirement was offered for sale to the Albany population.
A number of incidents involving vessels carrying passengers or crew with infectious diseases produced a call for quarantine facilities at the port. For example in February 1853 the Sir William Molesworth ran aground near the entrance to Princess Royal Harbour (see entry). En route Glasgow to Melbourne, 14 of the 220 passengers had died of scarlet fever while another six had died of other diseases. No contact was allowed with Albany apart from a little food supplied to the ship, which was quickly sent on its way. The visit of the R.M.S. Salsette in 1860 resulted in three of the Albany population coming down with scarlet fever. As there was no place to quarantine anyone the suggestion was made that the Larkins should in future be used as a lazarette to quarantine passengers with contagious diseases. It was so used in March 1865 when a girl passenger aboard the R.M.S. Bombay spent 21 days on the hulk recovering from scarlet fever. The lack of a suitable place for isolating infected people finally resulted in the building of a quarantine station at Geake Point, commencing in late 1874.
The vessel is also the oldest ship ever to wear the flag of the P&O Company.
SOCIAL (3)
The first mate on the Larkins when it arrived at Albany in 1853 was Hugh Mercer Thomas, who became superintendent of the P&O Company’s operations at Albany until 1864. He then accepted the position of Clerk of Courts, a position he held until his retirement in 1898.
ARCHAEOLOGICAL (4)
The Larkins is of archaeological importance, being an example of a wooden East Indiaman built very early in the 19th century. This was later than the Battle of Trafalgar but before Waterloo. The remains may therefore provide information on ship construction practices of this period.
INTERPRETIVE (6)
The remains of the Larkins may provide potential for public education through on-site signage. Its history covers a wide area of interest – The Honourable East India Company, the transport of convicts to Australia and the use of coal hulks.
RARE (7)
The Larkins is a rare example of an East Indiaman, built in India and sailed to many ports around the world. ‘For more than two centuries these stately, magnificent ships were generally acknowledged to be the lords of the ocean’ (Kemp, 1976: 281). The wreck is also rare as an example of a vessel which made voyages to Australia carrying convicts during the first half of the 19th century.
REPRESENTATIVE (8)
The Larkins is representative of the many wooden coal hulks used for decades at Albany, and which have now all been sunk or burnt.

Larkins (1808-1876) ex Louisa
The Larkins was constructed in Calcutta, India in 1808 of teak and saul (an Indian hardwood), fitted with 12 guns and originally named Louisa. In 1809 the Louisa sailed to London and was bought by East India Company ship owner John Larkins, and renamed Larkins. Between 1817 and 1852 the Larkins undertook a number of voyages between England and India, Australia and China. For some of these voyages the Larkins was fitted out as a convict transport, transporting 250 male convicts from England to New South Wales in 1817, 200 convicts from Cork, Ireland to New South Wales in 1829, and 281 convicts from England to Tasmania in 1832. In London in 1853 the P&O Company bought the Larkins for use as a floating coal depot in Albany, becoming Albany’s first coal hulk.  The ship was loaded with 1000 tons of coal, stores and 1000 pounds of confectionery, along with 20 passengers for the voyage from the River Thames to Albany. After 30 years in this role in 1875 the Larkins was declared unfit for service. The hulk was dragged ashore and broken up. The Larkins’ figurehead had been previously removed after a collision with RMS Bombay. In 1882, two years after the P&O Company’ Albany coal station closed, the figurehead was erected outside a boarding house in Albany. The figurehead survived various moves and being thrown down a well by Albany larrikins, before being donated to the WA Museum. Remains of the hull of the Larkins and the old P&O coal jetty are believed to lie under reclaimed land within the Albany Port Authority wharves area.
If found, the remains of the Larkins would be archaeologically and historically significant for their contribution to the study of Indian shipbuilding, and its long historical association with Albany coaling trade and the P&O Company.","NO","India","","","","","N","2009/0150/SG _MA-59/98","Y","N","-35.034013","","39.30","","117.894658","","","","Calcutta","","","","Historical map GIS","Protected State","Worsley P. & J.

"Lass of Geraldton","1867/03/25","Murray River 0–11 miles south of Robert Point","William Garrard","George Shenton, Charles Crowther","Henry O'Grady","","Y","4.80","","2 tons Flour, 14-15 tons sand","","The 2-masted schooner Lass of Geraldton was built by William Garrard at Geraldton from timber and fittings taken from the wrecked ship African. He purchased the material from Lionel Samson who, having bought the wreck for £70, employed Daniel Chapman to break it up. The Lass of Geraldton had one deck and a square stern. Garrard also built two other vessels from his purchase of African timbers bought from Samson—the schooner Mary Ann (O/No. 36551), 33.28 registered tons, and the sailing lighter Albatross.
Lockier Burges in his book The Pioneers of the Nor’-West Australia described the schooner on an earlier voyage:
The Lass of Geraldton was a strange looking craft. Being first built as a cargo boat, she was subsequently added to aft in order to carry passengers. If not weighed down heavily forward she had a habit of cocking her bow straight up, then making a dive forward and burying herself up to the bulkheads in every sea. The captain and myself had to move about 140 bags of wheat and two tons of lead ore forward to steady her (Burges quoted in Henderson, 1988: 71).
In his evidence to the subsequent Court of Inquiry Captain O’Grady described the schooner as ‘rather crank than otherwise’ (Gazette 5 April 1867: 2c-d).
The Lass of Geraldton departed Fremantle at 8.00 a.m. on 25 March 1867 bound for Bunbury under the command of Henry Wyndham O’Grady with a crew of four men, Henry McPherson, Michael Lawson, Peter Thompson and a German cook, name unknown. There were also two passengers, one of whom was George Shenton, a joint owner of the schooner with Charles Crowther of Geraldton. The other passenger was C. Teede. The vessel was in ballast, consisting of about 14 or 15 tons of sand, as the only cargo was two tons of flour.
THE LOSS
About 1.00 p.m. on 25 March the Lass of Geraldton was carrying full sail with a fair wind. O’Grady called Lawson to relieve him at the helm and then, after checking the barometer, went aloft to check his position. Captain O’Grady saw a slight squall approaching and had the crew shorten sail and ‘scandalize’ the main (by lowering the peak and raising the tack). Almost immediately the vessel was hit by this squall from the north-west and became unmanageable. The vessel heeled over under the wind and sank in about five minutes, some 10 or 11 miles south of the entrance to the Peel Inlet and 7 miles from land. The vessel’s dinghy had been securely lashed to the deck, but there was no time to cut it free. Both passengers and three of the crew were drowned; and only Captain O’Grady and Peter Thompson (also known as Dandy) got ashore after about five hours in the water. O’Grady related how he ‘held poor Mr. Shenton on a hatch for four hours, and saw he was dead before I left him, and I also saw two of the crew dead’ (Gazette, 29 March 1867: 2d). The search parties could see the vessel from the shore as it was in a depth of only 14 m with a mast protruding above water.
INQUIRY
A Court of Inquiry held at Fremantle on 30 March 1867 found that neither Captain O’Grady nor any of his crew was to blame for the sinking of the Lass of Geraldton.
INITIAL SALVAGE
While unsuccessfully searching for survivors from the wreck, some hatches and ten bags of flour were found. The wreck was examined by some people who thought it possible that the Lass of Geraldton might be raised. Although two coasters were subsequently sent to attempt this salvage of the schooner there is no record of any success, and the registry was closed on 20 December 1867.
SITE LOCATION
Divers from the Western Australian Museum in May 1995 carried out an inspection on a wreck on Bouvard Reef, and speculated that the material may have come from either the Bee or the Lass of Geraldton, both lost in this vicinity. The GPS position of the site inspected is 32° 50.492 S and 115° 35.166 E, almost ten miles south of Cape Bouvard. This site seems to fit best with that of the wreck of the Comet (see entry) as Captain O’Grady stated that the Lass of Geraldton was wrecked 10–11 miles south of the Peel Inlet.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The site runs north-south and covers a fairly large area of approximately 200 m by 80 m in about 10 m of water. There are three small sections of wreckage including five loose planks, a section of keel with two iron protrusions and a bronze bolt, and some frames averaging 100 mm square. The planks vary in length from 3 to 9 m. Two have a width of 200 mm and a thickness of 40 mm, another is 320 mm wide and 40 mm thick with some 25 mm diameter holes and two bronze bolts, and there are two planks 200 mm wide but only 25 mm thick. There is also a wooden construction in good condition 1.8 m by 1.5 m and 50 mm thick, possibly made of pine, to which is attached a length of chain.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
A sample of timber collected during the wreck inspection was examined by Dr Ian Godfrey, Western Australian Museum, who reported it to be a Eucalyptus species, possibly jarrah or karri. This would seem to indicate a locally built vessel, such as the Coolgardie or the unnamed lighter (1913). As mentioned above the Lass of Geraldton was built of timber recovered from the wreck of the African, an English-built ship. There is, however a possibility that some eucalypt timber was used in its construction, or during any subsequent additions, alterations or repairs. The Bee was wrecked on the beach, not offshore.","NO","WA","6","","5","2.10","N","2013/0001/SG _MA-206/80","Y","N","-32.8415333333","","18.40","","115.5861","","","52231","Champion Bay","Fremantle","Fremantle","Bunbury","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

"Laughing Wave","1903/08/29","Koombana Bay, alongside jetty","","John Bateman & Walter Bateman, Fremantle","","Gale","N","6.70","","","","Laughing Wave was built by William Jackson at South Beach, Fremantle. It had one deck and a round stern, and the first owners were John and Walter Bateman, joint owners. Walter Bateman’s shares were transferred to John on 27 January 1875, when Walter was declared a lunatic. John Bateman then took out a mortgage for £1 839 at 8%, which was discharged in July 1878. Bateman sold the brig to William Douglas of Fremantle in May 1901. In September that year Douglas mortgaged the Laughing Wave for £600 to the Western Australian Bank, that mortgage being discharged on 2 October 1901. In April 1902 Douglas sold the Laughing Wave to a consortium consisting of M.J. Davis, F.W. Hankinson and F. Kopler, contractors of Perth, who became joint owners.
The brig was damaged on a number of occasions, being blown ashore at Woodman Point in March 1872, and being badly holed in March 1889 when a storm drove it against the Fremantle Jetty. In June 1896 it was again driven ashore, this time at South Beach. In each case it was refloated and repaired.
The Laughing Wave arrived in Bunbury on 27 August 1903 from Fremantle with a cargo of ten tanks of malt for the local brewery, some spirits, kerosene and 20 tons of general cargo, with a total value of £1 000. The cargo was fully insured. The vessel was valued at either £600 (McKenna, 1967) or £750 but insured for only £300 (Bunbury Herald, 2 September 1903: 2e). The vessel was under charter to Messrs Lewis and Reid, contractors, who were building the jetties at Carnarvon and Point Sampson. It was under the command of John Davidson, with Ernest Chadingbowr as mate and a crew of three (Bunbury Herald, 31 August 1903: 2d) or four (McKenna, 1967), and was to load timber for use in the construction of those northern jetties.
THE LOSS
Arriving from Fremantle on Thursday 27 August the Laughing Wave was at anchor when a storm blew up from the north, causing the vessel to part its port anchor cable. The brig then drifted and hit the wreck of the barque Solglyt, losing its rudder. It was made secure at anchor again, and at noon on Friday was brought alongside the jetty by the steam tug Dunskey. The Laughing Wave was berthed on the southern side of the jetty in 13 ft (4.5 m) of water, and, because of the collision with the wreck of the Solglyt, was making a little water. The pumps, however, easily coped with this.
The heavy swell caused the brig to pitch and roll, and at 3.30 a.m. on Saturday 29 August, in rolling to port, it struck the lower structure of the jetty, causing some of the planks of the vessel to be stove in. A heavy inrush of water occurred and, despite every effort being made, it continued to gain on the pumps. At 6.00 a.m. the services of the Dunskey were again called for, this time to help with the pumping, but the water continued to gain and at 8.00 a.m. the Laughing Wave sank with only the bulwarks and rigging showing above sea level. The sea bottom at the berth where the brig lay was rough rock, and as the vessel continued to roll in the heavy weather the bottom of the hull was seriously damaged.
Captain Arundel, the Lloyd’s representative, inspected the Laughing Wave on Sunday 30 August, and the following day a diver was sent down to salvage the cargo, much of which was, by its nature, relatively undamaged. Intermittent violent weather, and the continued rolling of the vessel, rendered this task very difficult, but by Wednesday it was almost completed. Doubts were expressed about raising the vessel, as it was considered that while the 35 year old brig would have been repairable after the initial bump on the jetty, the subsequent knocking about on the rough bottom had very seriously damaged the hull.
The West Australian reported on the storm:
A Bunbury telegram of yesterday stated:- ‘Last night was one of the roughest that has been experienced here during the recent winter. The storm caused considerable anxiety to shipmasters in the present unprotected state of the harbour’ (West Australian, 29 August 1903: 6a).
INITIAL SALVAGE
It is not clearly stated what happened to the Laughing Wave. The Bunbury Herald has the brig listed as being in port until 7 September, but it is not subsequently mentioned as having left that harbour. McKenna (1959) reports that it was wrecked alongside the Bunbury wharf on 29 August 1903 and that the Certificate of Registry was delivered up and cancelled on 2 May 1904. McKenna (1967) has a notation from the incident as reported to the Registrar of British Ships, Port of Fremantle, that the Laughing Wave was a total wreck. Loney (1994) is also of the opinion that the brig became a total wreck and was abandoned. Dickson (1996 & 1998), however, reports that it was sold to Singaporean interests by Captain Rickers, a part owner of the vessel along with William Douglas. There is a notation in McKenna (1959) that on 1 February 1892 John Bateman provided a certificate of sale to Alfred Rickers, master mariner, to sell the vessel at Singapore for not less than £800 within three months of the certificate date. This certificate was subsequently cancelled and no sale took place.
It would appear that the Laughing Wave was wrecked in August 1903, and not subsequently salvaged. It would most likely have been dismantled where it lay alongside the Bunbury Jetty, or at least enough removed so that it to no longer became an impediment to other vessels using the jetty.","NO","WA","6","","","3.40","N","405/71","N","N","","","32.20","","","","","61085","Fremantle","Fremantle","Fremantle","Bunbury","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

In both 1882 and 1884 the Laura was stranded at Lockeville, but on each occasion it was salvaged and placed back in to service. It was later purchased by Frederick Douglas and refitted. In 1910 the boat was used by one of his sons, Carl, who sailed from Albany to Cape Leeuwin to salvage large quantities of butter which had floated free from the wreck of the steamer Pericles.

"Leander","1853/11/13","White Point, Irwin","","Smith and Co.","Captain Johnston","","N","","","General","A 752"," Leander was built at New Brunswick in 1849 of birch, pine and spruce, iron fastened. The North American vessels were mostly built of softwoods and did not have the working life of those made of hardwood (e.g. oak). The draught when loaded was 13 ft 6 in (4?m) but it was noted that when the vessel left Fremantle heading to Champion Bay on what proved to be its final voyage, it only drew 9 ft (2.7?m). This indicates that it was only carrying a small amount of cargo. This was fortunate as it enabled the Leander to bump across the reef as described below and reach the shore.
The owners were Smith & Co., and Captain R. J. Johnston was the master at the time it was wrecked. There was a crew of 22 ‘Malay’ sailors and the ship’s apprentice, E. Bruce, on board. Here it should be noted that ‘Malay’ was incorrectly applied during the 19th century to ‘generally describe those people inhabiting the islands to the north of Australia’ (McCarthy, 1989: 6). It included Malaysians, Singaporeans, Timorese (also referred to as Kupangers, Coepangers or Koepangers), Indonesians and Philippinos (often referred to as Manillamen). The term was used indiscriminately except where there was a direct reference to a particular place of origin.
Leander was carrying general cargo for Champion Bay. After discharging the cargo it was to load ore at Port Gregory for Singapore. From there it was to head for England, and would not be returning to Western Australia.
There were six passengers on board: Henry Robert Grellet, Robert Evans, Kenneth Brown (later of ‘Glengarry’), two new miners, Ashton and Cole, and Thomas Drummond of ‘Oakabella’ (eldest brother of James and John). The day before it was wrecked one of the Malay crew had died and was buried at sea late that same afternoon.
THE LOSS
Captain Johnston thought the ship’s position to be 4 miles further north from its actual position. Hove to under close reefed fore topsail and mainsail because of a northerly storm, the Leander struck a reef about 10 miles offshore. This occurred at 10 p.m. on 13 November 1853. The reef struck was about 14 miles south of the mouth of the Irwin River, and the Leander bumped across it losing the rudder and sustaining damage to the hull. It began to take in water, and the master set all sail in order to run it on to the beach. It was fortunate that the vessel’s shallow draught, the result of its light loading, enabled it to cross the reef. It was run aground ‘in a very favourable place’ (Resident Magistrate to Col. Sec. CSO 256/202, 3 Dec. 1853, quoted in Henderson, Research notes). The wreck very quickly settled into the sand.
All the passengers and crew got ashore safely, using two of the brigantine’s boats. A kedge anchor was also taken ashore. This secured a line from ship to shore and aided the movement of the boats as they salvaged cargo and goods. The following day, after an argument between the master and the Malay crew, the crew set off to walk along the beach towards Fremantle. Eleven returned the next day, but there is no record of what happened to the others. Attempts by some of the crew to walk north to Geraldton were also unsuccessful. It was not until thirteen days after the wrecking that one of the passengers, Robert Evans, with the assistance of a local Aborigine, obtained help from Lockier Burges on the Irwin River.
INQUIRY
The Resident Magistrate, William Burges, Captain H.A. Sanford and G.C. Evans held a survey on the vessel and condemned it as a total wreck. Captain Johnson received criticism for his treatment of the crew, as it was alleged that the reason for them leaving was that Johnson had taken away their rice rations. He later left the government to care for seven of the crew, while the remainder worked for their food, some at the Geraldine Mine and others at Port Gregory. The crew were owed wages, but they were neither paid by Captain Johnson nor repatriated back to their own country.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Food was brought ashore from the wreck together with a horse, a sheep and at least one case of claret. Spars and sails were used to erect tents on shore. A sand-bar quickly formed between the ship and the shore, enabling some of the cargo to be saved by men wading out in water only knee deep. While a portion of the cargo was found to be damaged, much was totally lost. The Helen and Mary took some of the salvaged cargo on to Port Gregory two months later.
SITE LOCATION
The vessel settled near a large ‘sand ridge that ran several kilometres inland and was a prominent feature’ (Henderson, 1988: 18). This would suggest that the Leander was wrecked close to White Point. The survivors of the wreck of the Cochituate, walking south in 1861, came across yards and pieces of wreckage on the beach about 20 km south of the Irwin River. It is possible that this wreckage was from the Leander.
SITE DESCRIPTION
Despite a number of searches the wreck of the Leander has not been found. There is strong evidence that the wreck site is near White Point as old charts show only this prominent sand patch in the general area. The coastline there appears to have moved up to 50 m seaward over the years. Particular reference should be made regarding the detailed research carried out by R. Sheppard and J. Clarke (see WAM File No. MA-115/80—Dongara Wrecks).
Leander at 173 tons was one of the first substantial vessels to enter the smaller ports and anchorages along the Western Australian coast.

Roberts","Grounded and wrecked on the sandbar","N","4.27","","","334"," Leviathan was built at Soldiers’ Cove, Mandurah, by Charles Olaf Wilson, together with his two sons. Building commenced in 1916 and took four years to complete. Wilson was 85 at the time the ketch was launched. Built mainly of jarrah, the vessel had a keel 16 inches (406 mm) wide and 9 inches (229 mm) deep, with only 1 inch (25 mm) showing outside the hull, and had two centre-boards. It was used for carrying timber from L.B. Bolton’s sawmill at Mandurah to Fremantle, bringing stores and general cargo on the return trip. This timber, mostly tuart, was mainly in the form of cart and wagon wheel spokes, felloes, axle boxes, and other components for the construction of carts, drays and wagons. When launched the Leviathan was not completely finished, having no ceiling over the frames, or hatch covers. Tarpaulins were used over the hatches to keep out rain and seas. On arrival at Fremantle on its maiden voyage it was fitted with a winch on the foredeck to lower and raise the main mast, enabling it to pass under the Fremantle bridges. Capable of carrying about 20 tons of sawn timber, the Leviathan was fitted with a second-hand, very unreliable motor on its fifth trip. The ketch had been painted black and was locally known as ‘Black Bess’.
THE LOSS
On 25 August 1921 the Leviathan was starting its eighth voyage north, under the command of Billy Roberts. The ketch had on board a heavy cargo, and was quite low in the water. The engine would not run and Roberts had let it drift out with the tide. However it drifted onto the bar at the mouth of the Peel Inlet, so the anchor was dropped. On previous occasions it had gone aground on this bar, but each time had been got off by kedging, and the assistance of a launch and the tide. This time however, the efforts to refloat the ketch were unsuccessful. After about a week and during a gale, it filled with sea and sand through the open hatches and began to break up. The bottom of the hull later drifted ashore while much of the cargo sank into the sands of the bar.","NO","","","","","2.13","N","206/80","N","N","","","15.24","","","","","","","","","","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

It arrived at Albany from Southampton on 4 December 1862. During 1863-64 the lighters were assembled under the supervision of Captain Charles Loius van Zuilecom on a flat rock near the company’s jetty. Although described by the company as barges, they appear to in fact have been yawls, possibly capable of long sea voyages. On 4 May 1863 a Perth newspaper’s Albany correspondent reported:
The first of the P&O Company’s new lighters under construction has been launched and named Albany. I learn that the second is to be called Fremantle. Though these vessels are reckoned barges by the Company, they are really fine coasters of 140 tons each, length 76 feet, beam 18 feet, hold 10 feet, and masts of 45 and 20 feet, yawl rigged, and it was originally intended to sail them out from England (Inquirer, 13 May 1863: 2f).
This lighter, like that sunk in Frenchman Bay (see entry), most probably had a counter stern.
The second lighter was launched on 29 August 1863 by ‘Miss Symers’ (most probably one of the daughters of Captain Thomas Symers of Albany) and named Fremantle. The last was launched in April 1864.
The lighters were used by P&O to carry water, coal and stores out to ships anchored in Princess Royal Harbour. There is some evidence that at least in later years they were towed to the waiting vessels by tugs or launches. In his reminiscences Captain Ernie Donohue states that one of his jobs was towing three lighters ‘of 130 tons each from Frenchman’s Bay outside Albany to the Town jetty full of water for shipping callers’ (Marshall, 2001: 277). The lighters were divided by bulkheads into five or six separate holds, and were capable of carrying 500 tons of water. After the withdrawal of P&O from Albany, the lighters were used by the Douglas family and the Armstrong and Waters Lighterage Company.
This particular lighter, which had been lying abandoned on the beach near the Town Jetty, was purchased by Nobbie Pannet during 1925, and used by him to pull up the piles as the old public baths were demolished. Pannet claimed that when he obtained the lighter it had a number of holes in the hull, but he had patched these with old kerosene tins.
THE LOSS
In May 1928, having outlived its usefulness the lighter was sunk by explosives near Whale Rock, between that rock and Middleton Beach. According to reports, the bottom of the hull proved to be sound, and the explosives failed to make holes in it.
Another of the lighters was abandoned, probably about 1890, near the water supply at Whalers Beach in Frenchman Bay (see entry). The wreck of a third iron lighter is shown on two sketch maps, one by Howard Hartman and the other by Les Douglas, published in Marshall, 2001.

The lighter is thought to have had a counter stern (Bocock, et al: 35).
The second lighter was launched on 29 August 1863 by ‘Miss Symers’ (most probably one of the daughters of Captain Thomas Symers of Albany) and named Fremantle. The last was launched in April 1864.
The lighters were used by P&O to carry water, coal and stores out to ships anchored in Princess Royal Harbour.

The lighters were divided by bulkheads into five or six separate holds, and were capable of carrying 500 tons of water. After the withdrawal of P&O from Albany the lighters were used by the Douglas family, Nobbie Pannet and the Armstrong and Waters Lighterage Company.
THE LOSS
At some time about 1890 this lighter was abandoned in Frenchman Bay.
After being of no further use another of the lighters was destroyed near Whale Rock in 1928 (see entry). The wreck of a third iron lighter is shown on two sketch maps, one by Howard Hartman and the other by Les Douglas, published in Marshall, 2001. The wreck is shown just to the east of the base of the P&O coaling jetty.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of this lighter lies 10-15 m off the shore at Whaler’s Beach between the ruins of the old Norwegian whaling station and Vancouver Springs. 
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck lies in 3 m of water approximately parallel to the shore, with the bow pointing to the east. Excavations by Bocock, et al, in 1990 uncovered both the bow and stern posts, frames and plating, but the profusion of iron beams across the site prevented an examination of the keel. The wreck is about 24 m in length and 5.4 m wide. There is timber associated with the iron remains, which were assessed as being part of a timber deck. The structure of the barge has been badly broken up, a considerable amount has corroded away and the deck beams have collapsed. According to local sources the wreck originally lay on the beach until changes in the shoreline left it in the surf zone, where it is subject to considerable water and sand movement. This would probably have been a major contributor to its disintegration.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
Samples of timber were collected, along with a whale’s tooth.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
Water for filling the lighters was originally obtained from a spring that had been dammed at Frenchman Bay. It was then piped to the lighters along a small jetty. The dam remains, hidden in dense bush, but the pipeline and jetty have long disappeared. There is some evidence that at one time the water may have been conveyed to the floating dock (see entry) and stored there until required.
Charles Louis van Zuilecom was the designer and builder of the P&O Company’s floating dock, launched in April 1866, and the first of only three wooden floating docks built in Australia (see entry). He arrived in Albany on board the steamer Bombay (1 186 tons, Captain Methwen) at about the same time as the material and tools brought by the Haddington. He later resigned from the company and moved to Kojonup to become that town’s first resident magistrate.

THE VESSEL
The Loch Lomond was a steam launch purchased in early 1883 by Armstrong and Waters. As the vessel was not registered little is known regarding its specifications, however old photographs show it as having an elliptical stern. It was used as a tug and also to carry passengers to and from mail steamers. The Loch Lomond was licensed to carry 10 tons of cargo or 40 passengers. In October 1884 the launch underwent a refit:
Mr Alex Armstrong has improved his steam launch, Loch Lomond. The hull of the boat has been raised two feet all round and her sides thrown out about twelve inches, her engine  and boiler moved three feet further forward, making more room aft for passengers and doing away with the fore cabin. Her additions do not diminish her speed but made her more seaworthy and will carry 50 passengers. The stern compartment is being roofed over and canvas sides are being added to give protection in all weathers. The shipwrights work has been performed by Henry Russell in a most satisfactory [manner?] at Oyster Harbour, where she has been laid up for the past couple of weeks. She will soon be ready to return to her harbour duties (Albany Mail, 14 October 1884 quoted in Dickson, 2012: 129-130).
When not on these duties it was used for picnic excursions and fishing trips. Sometimes as a tug it was used in conjunction with the Perseverance, owned by the Douglas family. The vessels were of a similar size.
THE LOSS
There are no details of the loss of the Loch Lomond. A photograph taken in 1912 shows the vessel partly stripped and lying on the rocks on the foreshore below Lawley Park. This was in front of Armstrong and Waters’ storage shed. The boiler was not removed, as it was known to lie half buried in the sand some three years later. The launch may have just outlived its usefulness, been stripped of anything of value and abandoned.
SITE LOCATION
The remains of the Loch Lomond lie buried beneath the landfill associated with the modern development of the port.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
SOCIAL (3)
The Loch Lomond was well known in Albany being one of the general purpose vessels used in the harbour during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

"Lovspring","1900/07/22","Mushroom Rock","","J. Rode","C. Sand","Cable snapped, blown on the rocks","N","9.45","","Timber","1472","  Lövspring was a Norwegian barque built by N.O. Gjömle, having one deck, two tiers of beams and was sheathed with yellow metal. It was owned by J. Jörgensen, and had arrived at Hamelin Bay from Madagascar in June. Also in the harbour at that time were the barques Katinka and Nor’wester. All these vessels were there to load timber from Maurice Coleman Davies’ sawmill, and all the cargoes were insured with the Commercial Union Assurance Company. The barque Arcadia was also at anchor awaiting repairs after having previously been stranded. The Lövspring was under the command of C. Sand, with a crew of nine.
THE LOSS
One of the most severe storms to hit the South-West occurred in July 1900. This storm occasioned much damage and caused the loss of three vessels and the stranding of a fourth in Hamelin Bay. There were two phases to the storm—the first phase with winds from the north-north-west on 22 July, and a second phase when winds swung round to the south-west the following day. The Lövspring survived the first phase but was blown from the jetty during the second phase.
The Lövspring was moored to the north side of the Hamelin Jetty when the severe storm struck from the north-north-west. The barque was being pounded and ‘trying to jump on top of the jetty and smashing herself to pieces’ (McGregor, G.F., letter to McGregor, W., 1 August 1900). The wind then swung round and blew with equal ferocity from the south-west. The bow hawser on the barque snapped and the Lövspring was driven onto Mushroom Rock. It struck heavily and then slid off to sink in water deep enough to cover the hull, leaving only the top of the bulwarks and the spars and rigging above water. The captain and crew clung to the rigging during the night. The following morning, with the wind slightly abating, they managed to launch a boat and pull to the jetty. This boat was later used in the rescue of survivors from the wreck of the Katinka.
INQUIRY
There appears to have been no inquiry into the loss of the Lövspring (most probably because it was foreign owned).
INITIAL SALVAGE
After survey by Captain Webster, the Lloyd’s surveyor from Fremantle, the wreck of the Lövspring, along with two of the other vessels wrecked in the storm, was offered for sale by auction:
For Sale by Public Auction, on account of whom it may Concern, at Hamelin Harbour, at Noon 4th August, the Barque Norwester as she now lies stranded, the Barque Katinka as she now lies submerged, the Barque Lovspring as she now lies submerged.
For further particulars apply to
M.C. Davies
Karri and Jarrah Company, Ltd (West Australian, 1 August 1900:8d).
The amounts paid for the three barques were very low, and there appears to be only a record of the buyer for the Nor’wester, which was bought by M.C. Davies:
On the 4th inst., the stranded barques were sold by public auction, and realised as follows:- Nor’wester, £21; Lovspring, £27; Katinka, £2.10s (West Australian, 9 August 1900: 5b).
The lifeboat from the Lövspring in which the crew came ashore was apparently the only item salvaged at the time the barque sank.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
An anchor reputed to be from the Lövspring is displayed on the foreshore at the Hamelin Bay car park, and the ship’s bell was in the possession of Mrs Peggy Davies in 1986. Mrs Davies is the wife of M.C. Davies’ grandson. A letter from John Clarke in the museum file dated June 1991 reported the finding of some timber, yellow metal sheathing, stud link anchor chain and iron fastenings close to Mushroom Rock that may be associated with the barque.","NO","Norway","9","","","5.15","N","196/75","N","N","","","41.58","","","","","","Christiansand","Madagascar","Brenig","South Africa","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

Length:	Initial: 147.0 ft (44.8?m). After rebuild: 167.3 ft (51 m)
 Lubra was built by Laurence Hill & Co. of Glasgow in 1860, specifically for the Australian coastal trade. It was initially 147 ft in length, and fitted with a simple 50 hp engine. It was built under Special Survey, and had two decks and five bulkheads. According to a photograph in Parsons (1986: 180) the Lubra was rigged as a two-masted schooner. It would have been expected to carry and use sails, as this was the norm for most steamers right up until the late 19th century.
Captain J.R. Hansford Ward was chosen by the initial group of owners to oversee its construction in Scotland, and then sail the vessel to Australia. His name appears on the registration papers as being one of the owners. This group formed The Steamship Lubra Co., which was later amalgamated with three of their other companies to form the Spencers Gulf Steamship Co. This was in turn taken over in 1882–83 by the Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd, who thereby became the owners of the Lubra at the time of its wrecking. The early owners included Thomas Elder and Barr Smith, the founders of Elder, Smith & Co. Despite several company name changes, substantially the same group of people owned the vessel during its working life.
In 1876–77 the Lubra was sailed to Melbourne where it was lengthened by 20.3 ft (6.2 m). This increased the tonnage from the original 246 gross, to that shown. At that time the engine was replaced by a 60 hp, 2-cylinder compound engine manufactured by D. & W. Henderson.
The Lubra was initially used between Adelaide and ports on the east coast of Australia, but it was brought to Western Australia in 1885. Just prior to this the figurehead was removed and renovations made to the accommodation, so that by the time it came to Western Australia it could accommodate 28 passengers.
The Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd’s contract with the Postmaster General of Western Australia lasted from 1885 until 1888. This contract provided for a round trip to be made from Champion Bay to Albany and return twice in every four weeks. The arrival at Albany was to coincide with the arrival there of the fortnightly P & O steamers from the eastern state capitals. After the southern contract expired, the Lubra continued in the cargo/passenger/mail trade, but between northern ports and Fremantle, until it was wrecked.
THE LOSS
The Lubra departed Geraldton for Fremantle at 10.30 p.m. on 3 January 1898 under the command of Captain Arthur Denyer, with nineteen passengers and seventeen crew. At 9.30 the following morning the Chief Officer, Harris, altered course without advising the captain, as he thought the vessel was approaching too close to land. The course that had been set by the captain was south 1/2 east, but Harris changed this to south 1/4 west. Denyer came back on deck at 10 a.m. and saw that the course alteration had put the ship in a very dangerous situation. The engine was stopped, and then run slowly ahead to manoeuvre the vessel into safer waters. However the Lubra struck an uncharted reef that damaged the rudder, stern-post and propeller blades and caused a leak.
After the crew managed to get the vessel afloat the next morning, it proceeded towards Fremantle. However the damaged rudder carried away, and the Lubra became unmanageable until a jury rudder could be rigged. This rudder was constructed in about five hours using the ship’s derrick booms. The following morning the steamer Sultan (Captain Pitts), belonging to the rival Western Australian Steam Navigation Co., was asked to assist. The Sultan was either unable or unwilling to come and help, but did report the Lubra’s predicament on arrival at Fremantle. With the jury rudder in place, Captain Denyer had meanwhile headed towards Jurien Bay, the nearest port of shelter. There were high winds and seas when the ship arrived. Lubra had lost the two bower anchors and one of the kedge anchors as a result of hitting the uncharted reef, so the vessel was anchored in Jurien Bay, about 3 miles from the shore, using only the second kedge. The steamer Waroonga was asked to stand by.
The following day it was decided to beach Lubra off Island Point, but what had been thought to be a suitable sandy beach proved to be a line of reef. The kedge was again let go but the Lubra began pounding on the limestone and the rudder post and part of the stern carried away. The passengers, crew and mail were subsequently taken off by the Waroonga.
INQUIRY
An inquiry was held and the Chief Officer’s unauthorised alteration of course was part of the evidence presented. The charges against Captain Denyer were as follows:
1. Neglect and carelessness in not paying sufficient attention to see that the courses he had ordered to be steered were properly kept, knowing that he had only one certified officer on board keeping watch;
2. Gross neglect in giving orders from his bunk at about 6.00 a.m., without going on deck to examine the ship’s position;
3. Carelessness in not having kept a chart in a convenient place so that officers keeping the watch could have access to it at any time;
4. Want of judgment in heading for Fremantle after getting off the reef, rather than returning to Geraldton;
5. Carelessness in not getting the starboard anchor ready to go when anchored at Jurien Bay;
6. Want of judgment in not veering more than 82 m of cable on the port anchor when anchored south of Jurien Bay;
7. Carelessness in not having left night orders in writing(Cairns & Henderson, 1995: 284).
Charges 1, 4 and 7 were found to be proven and Captain Denyer’s master’s certificate was suspended for nine months.
During the hearing Captain Denyer made accusations against Captain Pitts of the Sultan regarding his ‘inhumanity’ in failing to render assistance when requested. These accusations were later withdrawn.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The Lubra was carrying virtually no cargo and, apart from the mail, nothing was initially saved. The steamer Torrens was charted to attempt to recover the passengers’ luggage, crew’s personal effects and any moveable fixtures.
SITE LOCATION
On Boiler Reef, 5 km on a bearing of 240° M from the jetty at Jurien Bay, between Favourite and Osprey Islands in 7 m of water.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The site is subject to considerable breaking surf on the surface and a strong surge on the bottom during normal swell conditions. A steam engine piston block approximately 3.7?m high just breaks the surface of the sea, and is surrounded by several lengths of propeller shaft, a thrust block, iron framing and some sections of hull framing and plating. Most wreckage lies in a depression 2–3 m deep in the otherwise flat sand and weed bottom. The extent of the visible wreckage is small, covering an area only about 25 m by 20 m.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
During the initial wreck inspection on 15 May 1983 a sample of hull iron was raised for analysis. Also recovered were a sample of ceramic-like material, a bronze ringbolt, a bronze band and a circular rubber bushing or gasket.","NO","Scotland","17","2002/10","","3.20","60 HP by Hendersons of Glasgow 2 Cyl Compound","2009/0154/SG _MA-7/83","Y","Y","-30.3019333333","","44.80","","114.9981833333","","","29368","Glasgow","Geralton","Sydney","Fremantle","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

It was built and owned by Abraham Beckmann and was en route Natal to Adelaide with a cargo of 400 tons of coal. The vessel had cost £4 600 to build and was insured for £3 500. The master, Captain Nicholas Merjanssen, had on board his wife and twin 8-month-old babies, and a crew of seven.
THE LOSS
On 19 March 1891, when the schooner Ludwig was 33 days out from Natal, fire was discovered in the cargo. The crew fought the blaze for four days but it was found that the masts had burnt through below deck. On 23 March, when some 130 miles (209 km) south-south-west of Cape Leeuwin they fell. All those onboard took to the one boat, which was only 19 ft (5.8 m) long with a beam of 6 ft (1.83 m). The boat was well provisioned and luckily the weather was fine so that the boat reached Flinders Bay some 60 hours later on 25 March 1891 with no lives lost.
On 29 March 1891 the police constable at Hamelin related:
I have to report that at Karridale on 28th March 1891, I accosted a stranger, who informed me that he was one of the crew who arrived at Karridale on the previous evening from Augusta—having landed there on the 25th in an open boat from the wreck of the German barquentine Ludwig which was burnt at sea. The remainder of his mates were at Augusta and I proceeded there to make enquiries. On my arrival, I learned from Captain Nicholas Menjausson [sic] that the crew, the Captain’s wife and two infants were all safe. The captain reports the Ludwig sailed from Natal 13th February 1891 with a cargo of coal, bound for Adelaide. At 4.30 a.m. in the morning of 19th March, fire broke out in the coal. He says the crew worked hard but the fire could not be controlled. At 3.30 a.m. on the 23rd the vessel was abandoned 120 miles south/south west of Cape Leeuwin. Captain says that the last they saw of the ship the fire had spread to the rigging, masts and all but the forepeak. The Captain, his wife and two infants are the guests of Mrs Ellis—The rest of the crew are at Karridale (quoted in Teahan, 2008: 30).","NO","Germany","8","","","3.90","N","","N","N","","","36.10","","","","","","Papenburg","Natal","Papenburg","Port Adelaide","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., (2012).

MANNING RIVER. : Monday May 17th 1875
""Messrs. H. and T. Gollan launched from their ship-building yard, a little above Tinonee, their maiden vessel. Her dimensions are: length on keel, 67 feet; depth of hold, 7 feet; length overall, 80 feet; beam 18 feet. She was named the Maggie Gollan, is to be ketch rigged, and is intended for the Manning trade"". Australian Town and Country Journal (Sydney, NSW) Saturday 22nd May 1875
Maiden voyage:
After being rigged out, the Maggie Gollan left the Manning River and arrived in Sydney on the 16th July 1875.
Hector Gollan sailed on her as part of the crew for a number of years before gaining his Certificate of Competency as a Master on the 9th of April 1878.
Captain Gollan's Pilot Certificate allowed him to pilot vessels under 100 tons, trading from the ports of Sydney, Newcastle, and the Manning River. He successfully did so for eight years, and reportedly had the distinction of being the first skipper to bring a ship over the Manning River bar at night. This was reputably accomplished in a calm sea with a flood tide, broadside on and with a good knowledge of the channel and landmarks.
Collision : 1888
On the 1st June 1888 the Maggie Gollan was inbound to Sydney off South Head at around 8.15 pm, when she came into collision with the outbound steamer Platypus.
The steamer Platypus was on a voyage from Sydney to Newcastle when she struck the Maggie Gollan on the starboard quarter, causing considerable damage to the ketch.
The Board of Inquiry found that the collision was due to a wrongful act by the master of the Platypus, breaching the navigational steering rules.
Sold :
The Maggie Gollan continued trading along the NSW Coast until March 1895 when she was sold to Mr J. F. Tiffany of Cossack, Western Australia (date of sale unconfirmed).
Ketch in a storm : 1895
On the 9th April 1895 the Maggie Gollan left Sydney, bound for Cossack WA, loaded with timber and dynamite.
Two days into the voyage the ketch was subjected to heavy seas and easterly gale force winds for almost forty hours.
During the buffeting one extra large swell came on board shaking her from stem to stern, taking out portion of her steering gear.
Adding to the awkwardness of the situation the main sail was shredded, and as a result, Captain Franks was forced to bring her head before the wind, during which one of the crew was swept over board. With some difficulty he was safely rescued and the Maggie Gollan managed to make the port of Williamstown. Evening News (Sydney, NSW) - Friday 19 April 1895.
The ketch, Maggie Gollan, which called into this port for a consignment of explosives for conveyance to West Australia, underwent examination by the shipping inspector, Captain Deary, who found that the mainmast of the vessel was sprung, and he would not sanction the craft's departure until this spar was replaced. It will he remembered that whilst coming from Sydney the Maggie Gollan encountered some particularly heavy weather, and probably during its continuance after the accident to the mast occurred. A portion of the explosives intended to be conveyed by the craft had been placed on board before the inspector boarded the vessel. These were again discharged into the powder hulk, and the whole consignment will be placed on hoard the steamer Melbourne, which vessel proceeds to West Australia immediately on its receipt on board. The work of supplying a new mast for the Maggie Gollan has been entrusted to Mr. W. S. Knights, of the Patent Slip, Williams town. The Age (Melbourne, Vic.) - Monday 22 April 1895

"Magnolia","12494","Between Red Bluff and Gnaraloo","","","","Caught in strong current","Y","3.80","","800 to 900 lb Lady Schnapper","","
After being reported by  Peter Fox, in October 1980, a then unidentified wreck c. 9 kilometres south of the  Gnaraloo  station homestead was inspected by M McCarthy assisted by  Colin Powell and Geoff Kimpton.  The position, fixed in the pre GPS era was recorded as 23°50’S., 113° 31’E. When he reported finding the wreck  Mr Fox delivered to the Museum  one glass burner top, a red glass fragment, assorted plank spikes (95mm by 11mm square) and assorted  brass bolts  1.25cm in diameter. The inspection team recovered   two lead pipe lengths 6cm diameter, a small sounding lead (16cm) and two  fishplates. 
In the inspection report, the site was described as  small, lying in 1-2 metres of water depending on the tide and consisting of iron keel sections, iron ribs, chain, 2 small Admiralty type anchors (one 1.15m by 1.75m) , one  with a folding stock, 1 small windlass (1.15m long),  a section of another windlass and two sections of lead keel out to sea. The main section of wreckage consisted of two keel sections with brass bolts (60cm by 2.5cm) measuring approximately 15 metres along the main axis.
Of all the known wrecks on the  coast, the finds and these  scantlings best  fitted the circumstances of  the  fishing boat  Magnolia,  which according   to A.C. Burns who compiled a history of early fishing boats in the region ‘ended her illustrious career when caught in a strong current during the night and went ashore at Red Bluff, north of Cape Cuvier’ on March 17  1938 .
Though Red Bluff is further south, it is the most prominent feature on the relatively featureless coast south of Point Cloates and it is often used to describe the entire region  in the vicinity of the Bluff.  Further  the  tentative  identification of the wreck  as the Magnolia was confirmed  by Mr A. Fleming, whose family had owned the Gnaraloo  station  until a few years prior to the inspection in 1980.  Mr Fleming also advised that the wreck had been salvaged  by  Carnarvon identity  ‘Tito’ Reynolds. 
When considering this, and the then relatively modern nature of the site the  inspection report finished with the advice  that ‘the site and does not fit any of the criteria laid down for consideration as an historic wreck’.
According to  Burns, 
The sea which was not unduly rough, was breaking heavily over the reef, and at the point where the boat went aground was comparatively calm, compared with the areas on either side. The skipper and two crewmen did not leave the boat until she was practically broken up, and getting away in the dinghy they were able to save the sails and some of the gear. After reaching shore they walked to Gnarloo Station the property of r E.K. Roberts, about 7 miles away and acquainted him of the mishap to the boat. Mr Roberts then drove the men in his truck to the scene of the wreck Magnolia, and with the dinghy and gear loaded in the truck were conveyed to Carnarvon, then to Geraldton. At the time of the loss of the Maggie she had in her ice box 800 to 900 lb of Lady Schnapper.
The Magnolia had an interesting history and had been the property of a local firm Winter Brandt and Co. for 30 years. She was 58ft long with a beam of 12’6” and a draft of 10’6”. She was originally built in England and was brought out in sections to Botany Bay, where he was put together. For many years she was a crack sailing yacht in Sydney and Melbourne waters before being acquired for fishing.
 In 1989 Mr Bruce Teede of Carnarvon donated fastenings  he had recovered from the wreck ‘20-25 years ago’  to the Museum. He also advised  that in salvaging the wreck, the Reynolds brothers  made a ramp for their Landrover from  the shore out to the site and drove out to it at low tide, recovering what they could. Teede to  McCarthy, January 1989, 209/80/1)  With a 75-year rolling date now accepted as the sole necessary  criterion for historic status in recent years, the Magnolia will automatically become historic   within in a few years..

 Maid of Lincoln was a wooden steamer built in Port Lincoln, South Australia, by Henry Crawford. It was carvel built with one deck, two masts, schooner rigged, a straight stem and a round stern. It was fitted with 12 hp engines. The first owners were William Frederick Haigh and Henry Crawford. It was brought to Fremantle in 1887 (Cairns & Henderson, 1995) or 1889 (Parsons, 1990) and mainly used for harbour work by its new owners, Symon, Hammond & Hubble.
The Maid of Lincoln was involved in an incident in October 1889 when it caught fire while at anchor in South Bay. The fire was put out before destroying the vessel, but it suffered a great deal of damage.
The Maid of Lincoln left Dongara at 4.00 p.m. on 11 April 1891 carrying a cargo of guano, under the command of Captain William Millar, intending to call at Fremantle for coal en route to Bunbury.
THE LOSS
Initially the Maid of Lincoln headed south but this was altered to south by east then later south-south-east. Captain Millar went below at 10.00?p.m. but when he returned to the deck a little after midnight he found that the helmsman had not been able to steer the ordered course. The vessel was heading south by 1/2 east, and consequently getting closer to the coast. Presuming the helmsman had a clear view, he ordered that course to be continued and the mainsail kept full. Captain Millar then went below again, but was awakened shortly after 2.00 a.m. when the steamer struck a reef. He ordered the engines to be reversed but to no avail, as the vessel was hard and fast. As the water was rising quickly the order was given to launch the ship’s boat.
The Maid of Lincoln sank before the crew were able to save any food or clothing. They landed safely at Jurien Bay, about 13 km to the north of the wreck site. Half of them had no shoes, and so remained near the beach, while the others walked to Walter Padbury’s station at Cockleshell Gully. The crew were then picked up and taken to Geraldton by horse and cart, and afterwards to Fremantle by the steamer Dolphin.
INQUIRY
Captain Millar had his certificate suspended for six months.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The steamer Dolphin, carrying the survivors from Geraldton to Fremantle, searched the wreck site as they headed south, but no trace of the Maid of Lincoln could be found.","NO","SA","","","","2.00","Screw Steamer 12 HP","118/80","N","N","","","22.40","","","","","89419","Port Lincoln","Abrolhos","","Fremantle vai Dongarra","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

Brovig, Norway","Emile Tonnesen","In Ballast","Y","10.00","","Ballast, 400 tons sand","AUS 758, 1034"," The iron barque Mandalay was built by Russel & Company (Yard No. 28), and launched on 6 August 1880 for W. & J. Crawford. It had one deck, two tiers of beams, one bulkhead and was cemented. The vessel had a poop 9.14 m long and a forecastle of the same length. In 1883 it was purchased by Anderson, Webster & Company of Glasgow. In 1903 the barque was sold to Messrs G.C. Brovig and E. Tonnessen, of Arendal, Norway. It had departed Delagoa Bay in ballast on 3 April 1911, under the command of Captain Emile Tonnessen (also referred to as Pounessen, Ponnessen and Jonnessen in various reports). He was a part owner, and had a crew of twelve, few of whom could speak English. It was heading to Albany for orders.
Only a few days prior to its loss the agents for the vessel had contacted the Harbour Department at Fremantle, requesting that the lighthouse keepers along the coast keep a lookout for the Mandalay. If sighted it was to be signalled to proceed to Flinders Bay, where arrangements had been made for the barque to take on a full cargo of timber for Buenos Aires.
The Mandalay was only partly covered by insurance, an amount of £1 000, ‘and not nearly to the extent of her full value’ (West Australian, 29 May 1911: 5e).
THE LOSS
About the time land was sighted on 13 May 1911 the Mandalay was hit by a heavy gale in position 35° 41 south, 112° 18 east. This quickly increased in strength until it became necessary to take in all sail. The following day the crew realised that the barque was being driven close to the shore so a small amount of sail was set on the foremast.   However, it proved impossible because of the fury of the wind to set any sail on the mainmast. It also proved impossible to either tack or wear the vessel so as to steer off shore. By 1.00 p.m. on Monday the Mandalay had been driven close to Chatham Island, only clearing this ‘by a few fathoms’ (Albany Advertiser, 27 May 1911: 3f-g). It was evident that there was nothing the crew could do to save the barque, so to hopefully save the crew Captain Tonnessen decided to beach the vessel on the coast two miles north-east of Chatham Island. It took the ground about 180 m from the beach, bumping hard. This resulted in the loss of the mainmast overboard, but the hull seemed to be still intact, or at least with only minor damage.
An able seaman, Knutson, jumped overboard intending to swim a line ashore. He was immediately hit by four big seas in quick succession, the line entangled his legs and he began to drown. The only non-Norwegian aboard, an English able seaman named Frank Ward (still a teenager), jumped in and was carried to the beach by a wave. He then swam back out to the aid of Knutson, and dragged him and the line ashore. Knutson by this time was unconscious. The crew on board launched the lifeboat, and using the line between ship and shore most of the crew were dragged to the beach. The seas were still driving the Mandalay shoreward, but the weather was moderating and before night fell they were able to return to the stranded vessel, pick up the remainder of the crew, and get some food.  Much of the food was lost in the waves during their endeavours. They also managed to salvage some sails and spars to make tents for shelter from the bitterly cold nights.
The Mandalay had by this time slewed broadside on to the sea with the surf breaking continually over it. One of the lifeboats lay smashed on the beach, although it was reported at the time that two more remained undamaged on board. The hold, empty except for 400 tons of sand ballast, was gradually filling with water from a hole in the forepart of the barque.
INQUIRY
On 27 May 1911 the Norwegian Consul in Perth, R.S. Haynes, assisted by Captain Smith and Captain Olsen acting as nautical assessors, conducted an inquiry into the loss of the Mandalay. The proceedings were held in camera, a copy of the evidence being later forwarded to the relevant authorities in Norway.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The following advertisement appeared in the West Australian (30 May 1911: 2d) newspaper:
Wrecked Barque Mandalay
Tenders will be received by R.S. Haynes, Consul for Norway, for the Wreck as it now lies on the beach near Chatham Island, consisting of Hull, all Gear, Boats, Chronometer and Ship’s stores.
Tenders must be addressed to the Consul, and reach the Consulate before the 14th day of June.
Richard S. Haynes
Consul for Norway, Perth.
There is a photo taken some 12 months after the wreck of the Mandalay which shows the vessel upright on the beach. It is evident from this photograph that there had been no major salvage work carried out. The spars and rigging appear more or less intact, apart from those taken ashore together with some sails to build shelters for the survivors. These, the ship’s boats, blankets, clothing and some food were saved, along with, presumably the chronometer and captain’s navigation equipment, and the ship’s papers.
The head of the figurehead was sawn off by George Payne of Manjimup and is now in the possession of T. and E. Gerner of Deep River Farm. Frank Thompson’s daughter, Phyllis, salvaged a number of large stoneware jars from the wreck in which the family preserved butter made on their farm. The Thompson family also managed to salvage some food from the wreck, a bounty for the isolated farm where obtaining supplies entailed considerable cost, effort and time. A man named Frank Read used some of the timber from the wreck of the Mandalay to make furniture.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Mandalay lies just offshore approximately 300 m east of the wooden viewing platform and information plaques at Mandalay Beach.
SITE DESCRIPTION
In August 1992 a wreck inspection by Tom Vosmer and staff of the Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum, found that the wreck of the Mandalay lies in the surf zone, approximately parallel to the shore on an axis of 112°-292°, and about 10-15 m from the mean low water shore line. At that time it was exposed to a height of 1-1.5 m, bow pointing to the west. Some hull plating remained, particularly along the starboard (shoreward) side of the wreck, mainly in the forward section. Some frames were visible, spaced at about 52 cm intervals. The windlass was clearly visible in the bow, but the stern had collapsed. The wreck is often covered in sand.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
In August 1992 a number of artefacts were collected during the wreck inspection described above. These include nails and iron bolts, two pulley sheaves, a fragment of carved wood, a Psalm book, the barrel of an 1893 Winchester rifle and some ceramic shards. There is a report in the Department of Maritime Archaeology file that the ship’s bell from the Mandalay is at “Perup” homestead, an old copper boiler at “Riverside”, a ship’s door being used as the door to a chaff shed at “Deeside” and a foghorn at the Manjimup Timber Museum.
Some years ago a fire in the historic Tinglewood Hotel destroyed a number of artefacts that had also been salvaged and were on display at the hotel.","NO","UK","13","1992","","6.00","N","2009/0159/SG _MA-4/86","Y","Y","-35.0061666667","","61.30","","116.533","","","81801","Greenock","Delagoa Bay, Mozambique","Tonsberg, Norway","Albany","Unknown","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J., In press.

"Marius Ricoux ex Rising Star, ex Sollecito, ex Sciaffino","1928/05/19","Near Bald Head","","","","","N","9.94","","","WA 1083, AUS 118, AUS 110 & BA 2619","Initially called Rising Star she was clinker built by Birrel, Stenhouse & Co. as their Yard No. 22, with one deck, one bulkhead, two tiers of beams, a counter stern and a clipper bow. It had a quarter deck 12.2 m long, and a forecastle 6.4 m in length. Initially owned by Captain H.H. Melmore and registered at Maryport, Cumberland, in England, it was sold to Ritson & Co. in 1889, but retained the Maryport registration. Its captain at that time was W.A. Nelson, who had started his working career as a sailmaker. In 1899 it was sold to A. Raggio, C. Solari and C. Chigizola and registered in Genoa, Italy. At first the name Rising Star was retained, but later changed to Sollecito.
In 1908 it was bought by M. Ricoux & Co., renamed Marius Ricoux, and registered at Marseilles in France. It is reported as arriving at Sydney in ballast from Monte Video on 4 October 1911 after a passage of 82 days, having experienced heavy gales during which some sails were blown out. The barque retained French registration until sold to McIlwraith, McEacharn & Company later that year, and registered at Sydney (No. 30/1911). This firm then converted it to a coal hulk, took it to Albany and moored it in Princess Royal Harbour.
THE LOSS
At the end of its useful life as a hulk the Marius Ricoux was towed by the tug Awhina ‘to a point well round Bald Head’ (West Australian, 26 May 1928: 19e). Explosives were placed in the bottom of the middle hold and covered with sand and rubbish to contain and direct the blast. The charge was fired and the resulting explosion blew a hole in the hulk, sinking it stern first in ‘13 fathoms [11.9 m] close to the shore, well out of the track of shipping’ (ibid.).
INITIAL SALVAGE
Prior to being sunk the Marius Ricoux was placed alongside the Town Jetty and stripped of everything useful, including the winch and boiler. The lower masts were left in place, possibly as they were of iron and of no use. The wheel also was not removed.
SITE LOCATION
The site where the Marius Ricoux was sunk is said to be in the ocean to the west of Bald Head, offshore from the Salmon Holes.","NO","UK","","","","5.64","N","","N","N","","","59.71","","","","","76139","Dumbarton","","Sydney","","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

"Marten","1878/03/04","Pelsaert Island","Robert Kennedy","Browse Island Guano Company of Adelaide","Captain Alexander Dewar","","Y","4.70","","Store, ballast","AUS 332","Marten was built as a two-masted schooner at Yarra Bank, Melbourne. The port of registry was changed from Melbourne to Fremantle in 1874 when George Wilson Robinson, master mariner of Fremantle, bought it from Robert Kennedy. Robinson sold it to John Henry Monger and John Watson on 21 July 1876, and Monger sold his half share to Watson on 1 August 1876. The vessel’s registry was transferred to the port of Adelaide on 21 October 1876, after purchase by the Browse Island Guano Company, an Adelaide based firm.
The Marten departed Fremantle on 2 March 1878 under the command of Captain Dewar, with a crew of five, en route to Darwin. The schooner was to be used by the owners as a dispatch vessel between Darwin and their guano works at Browse Island.
THE LOSS
The Marten struck the reef on the east coast of Pelsaert Island on the Houtman Abrolhos on the night of 4 March 1878 at about 11 p.m. After landing on the island three of the crew were left in charge of the wreck while the master and the other two rowed the ship’s boat to Geraldton to seek help, arriving on 13 March. When they returned it was to find the schooner’s starboard bilge badly holed, the keel and false keel gone and the rudder broken.
INQUIRY
At the court of inquiry the master claimed the Marten did not sail well and that, after seeing the breakers ahead, they had tried to tack the schooner but had missed stays. The court found that the loss was due to the adverse currents common in the vicinity of these islands.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Some of the stores were taken ashore by the survivors but there is no record of the Marten being salvaged. Its position within the line of breakers would have made this very difficult. The wreck was still visible in 1879 when John Forrest records seeing it during his survey of that part of the Abrolhos.
SITE LOCATION
The site of the wreck of the Marten is the same as that for the Ben Ledi, wrecked the following year. The site is about 7 km north of Wreck Point on the east side of Pelsaert Island in the Houtman Abrolhos.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreckage from the much larger Ben Ledi hides any possible remaining material from the Marten.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
A few objects recovered from Pelsaert Island by archaeologists from the WA Maritime Museum may be associated with the wreck of the Marten. A small mast step, some sheathing metal and a curved timber, possibly part of a vessel’s frame, have been found.

"Mary","1879/06/04","Lockeville Jetty","","William Pearse and Partners of Fremantle","John Waldron","At anchor","Y","5.20","","Jarra","BA 1069"," Mary was built at Fremantle by James Storey, having one deck and an elliptical stern. It was launched in December 1868, and was described as being an exceedingly smart craft. The first owners were the builder (16 shares), William Miles (16 shares) and William and George Pearse (jointly owning 32 shares). Storey mortgaged his shares to John Bateman for £100 at 15% in February 1870, the mortgage being paid off in July the following year. On the same day Storey sold his shares to William and George Pearse, as did Miles in November. In June 1873 the Pearse brothers sold 16 shares each to William Edward Marmion and John Tuckey. On the same day Tuckey mortgaged his 16 shares to the Pearse brothers for £170 at 10%, discharging it almost two years later in May 1875. At this time he sold his shares to Samuel Pearse, another member of the family.
The Mary had been at Binningup but the master, John Waldron, sought shelter at Lockeville because of approaching bad weather. There were four passengers on board, D. Pontivivo and three unnamed Malays.
THE LOSS
On 4 June 1879 the Mary was tied up alongside the jetty at Lockeville, but as the weather worsened the schooner was hauled off and moored to the West Australian Timber Company’s mooring about 180 m from the jetty. By 2.00 a.m. the following morning the heavy seas were breaking over the vessel, which dragged the mooring. The Mary hit a jetty pile and then went broadside on to the jetty. In this position it became impossible to manoeuvre the vessel into the lee of the jetty, so Waldron payed out cable to enable the schooner to be backed gradually into shallow water. After striking bottom a number of times the masts fell. The crew then scuttled the vessel to steady it and diminish the pounding. The Mary, however, became a complete wreck. The four passengers got ashore and travelled to Fremantle aboard the cutter Maud, arriving there on 21 June.
INQUIRY
A Court of Inquiry by J.D. Harris and J. Cookworthy, commenced on 9 June at Vasse but was adjourned to 14 June. Its finding cleared the master and crew of blame for the loss of the Mary.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The manager of the timber company requested that the harbour master, George Forsyth, remove the wreck. The Government’s legal advice was that legislation did not apply to private jetties and so its removal was not their responsibility. The company therefore bought the wreck, which by its position had been preventing repairs to their jetty from being undertaken.
SITE LOCATION
The remains of the wreck of the Mary lie close to the jetty piles, about 40 m from the shore.
SITE DESCRIPTION
When first inspected by Graeme Henderson of the Western Australian Museum in December 1970, the keel and sternpost of the Mary were visible, together with some frames projecting above the sand, a heap of ballast stones and some planking. A later inspection in February 1989 showed that much of this material had either disappeared or been buried under the sand. It may be presumed that, after purchasing the wreck in 1879, the Western Australian Timber Company salvaged much of its timbers in order to clear their jetty.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
The wreck inspection carried out in 1970 recovered rudder fittings, blocks, a pulley sheave and some ballast stones. The jarrah rudder of the Mary was recovered by fishermen from Busselton during the 1960s. This rudder was described as having been covered with coal tar, so was well preserved, and is now on display in the Busselton Museum.","NO","WA","","1993/12","","2.30","N","2009/0161/SG _MA-5/86","Y","Y","-33.617207","","20.00","","115.409537","","","61087","Fremantle","","Fremantle","","Aerial GIS","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

"Mary Ann","1876/07/13","Bellinger Island","","Messrs Pearse and Owston","John Christie","Went ashore","N","6.40","","Ballast",""," Mary Ann was built by John Eason at North West Bay, Tasmania, for Charles Hartam. It had one deck, a scroll head and a square stern, and was registered in Hobart (No. 39/1849). In August 1852 it was sold to John Foster, also of Hobart, and re-registered as No. 44/1852 at that port. Sold to J. Valentine in August 1860, the Mary Ann was once more registered at Hobart (No. 7/1860). In June 1866 Thomas Robertson of Williamstown, Victoria, purchased the schooner, which was then registered at Melbourne (No. 31/1866).
In March 1868 the Mary Ann was bought by Captain James McLean Dempster on behalf of a partnership consisting of Thomas Courthope Gull, Samuel Barker and Charles Edward Broadhurst. The schooner was fitted out in Melbourne for the pearling and trepanning industries in the north-west of Western Australia. The registration however remained at Melbourne with Barker shown as the owner. He had paid the purchase price for the Mary Ann while the others had contributed £200 for equipment, including diving gear. In fact there was a certain amount of resentment, as it appears that Broadhurst only paid £150, which was not his full share. The partnership was dissolved on 6 September 1870, and shortly after that Barker died; his widow Julia Barker then became the registered owner. In November 1871 she made the registration over to Thomas Gull, and he sold the Mary Ann to George Howlett on 5 March 1872. Howlett then registered the schooner at Fremantle (No. 1/1872).
Howlett used the Mary Ann in the Fremantle to Singapore trade, carrying sandalwood, mother-of-pearl and tortoise shell north, returning with sugar.  During early 1872 he sent it to Rosemary Island on a whaling voyage in an attempt to pay off a debt.  Howlett found himself in financial difficulties, and the Crown Solicitor seized the schooner on 4 June 1872.  However, two days later Howlett managed to mortgage the Mary Ann to John Connell, Charles Watson and William Hogath, all of Melbourne, for £2,000 at 10%.  Two days after that, on 8 June, the seizure was cancelled by the Crown Solicitor.
The mortgagees retained ownership of the Mary Ann until in December 1874 they sold the vessel for £405 to William Owston, master mariner, William Silas Pearse and George Pearse, all of Fremantle.
The Mary Ann was twice stranded; firstly in 1869 in Flying Foam Passage, and later in July 1871 at Champion Bay.
In July 1876 the owners had chartered the Mary Ann to William Miles to carry material for the overland telegraph line, and the schooner, under the command of John Christie, was returning from Israelite Bay having completed the task. On board were a crew of six and six passengers, one of whom was James Fleming, a senior official involved in the construction of the line.
THE LOSS
After leaving Israelite Bay on Wednesday 12 July 1876 Captain Christie found that progress was very slow, so the following afternoon he decided to anchor the Mary Ann in the lee of the Bellinger Islands. During the evening the wind changed direction. This put the schooner on a lee shore so Captain Christie prepared to leave. However, after setting the topsails and heaving the anchor cable short the Mary Ann would not cant. The schooner began dragging its anchor, and, despite furling the sails and paying out more cable, it continued to drag. Efforts to warp the vessel away from the shore were unsuccessful and, with a fresh north-easterly wind and heavy swell, the Mary Ann dragged ashore becoming a total wreck. All the crew and passengers got ashore safely.
INITIAL SALVAGE
In getting ashore from the wreck of the Mary Ann, the crew and passengers managed too salvage most of their personal possessions. Also saved were the sails and spars, as stated by William Miles in a telegram to the owners:
Bremer Bay, 31st July, 1876. Mary Ann wrecked on the Bellinger Island on the 13th. All saved. Will reach Fremantle middle of August; sails, spars, and other things secure. W.W. Miles (quoted in South Australian Advertiser, 17 August 1876: Supplement 2a).
The cutter Tribune, which had also been at anchor near the islands, took on board the survivors and all the salvaged gear.
SITE LOCATION
In April 1993 the Maritime Archaeology Department, Western Australian Museum, carried out a wreck inspection lead by Jeremy Green, with Ben Green, Peter Miles and Anthony Cusack. They found two areas of wreck material on the north-east side of the westernmost of the Bellinger Islands.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck material of the Mary Ann lies in two different sites. Between 100 and 200 m offshore in three metres of water is an area containing small artefacts, mainly copper alloy and bottle fragments. On the shore are some timber remains consisting mainly of frames. On the beach on the mainland opposite the island is a large mast which may be associated with this wreck. There are two possibilities regarding the scattered material:
The Mary Ann was wrecked in the shallows, subsequently partly salvaged, and what remained was then broken up in storms from the north and north-east.
The Mary Ann was wrecked between the east and northern ends of Bellinger Island, and the wreckage was then driven in large sections into the bay, the remains so far discovered being only part of the vessel.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
The Museum team took samples of timber from the wreck of the Mary Ann. On analysis these proved to be of a Eucalyptus species and a Shorea (meranti) species. Neither was definitively identified, but the Eucalyptus may indicate that, being Tasmanian built, part of the vessel was constructed of Tasmanian blue gum, a well-known ship building timber. Also retrieved were a copper alloy fitting and a fragment of sheathing also of copper alloy.","NO","Tasmania","6","","","2.74","","","N","N","","","25.60","","","","","31932","North West Bay, Tasmania","Israelite Bay","Fremantle","Middle Island","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

Government Resident's Office,
Roebourne, 25th May, 1869
SIR,-Herewith I have the honor to forward the statement of the master of the Mary Ann relative to the wreck of that vessel.
I believe Mr. Mc'Kenzie proceeds per Mary
to Fremantle.
I have the honor to he, Sir,
Your obedient servant,
R. J. SHOLL.
The Hon. the Colonial Secretary, &c, Perth. Statement of Mr. John McKenzie, master of the
schooner "" Mary Ann,"" relative to the wreck ot that vessel. Taken before the undersigned at Roebourne, this 18th day of May, 1869.
I was master of the "" Mary Ann."" That vessel left Port Walcott on the 1st April, 1869, having on board besides myself Mr. D. Chap- man, Mr. E. Chapman, Miss R. Chapman, C. J. Wilcox, and E. Percival. On the 3rd April we had a heavy gale of wind which carried away jib and staysail. We were at the time in Flying Foam Passage. On the 5th got three bolts of canvass from the "" Mary"" and made new jib and staysail. Left the passage on the l0th of April. We went among the islands collecting guano, and nothing particular occurred until the 28th of April. On that day at 4.30 p.m., while bearing up up for Rocky Island to anchor for the night the "" Mary Ann"" struck on a sunken rock with 3 fathoms all round her. The rock bears due W. from the centre of Rocky Inland, and two miles from low-water mark. The Rocky M m 1 bears N.E. from the Mangrove Islands, distant about 7 miles. It is about equi-distant between the Rivers Ashburton and Fortescue, and perhaps 12 miles from the main land. We saw that she was filling, and in five minutes the water was over the guano in the hold. Mr. Chapman went below to get provisions and I got out the dingy. We all got into the boat after taking sail off the vessel. When we left the water was over her deck and she was settling down. Landed the people on the island with one bag of flour and some clothing. I then went off to the vessel and found that she had slid off the rock and had slewed round with her head to S.W. She was full of water and very buoyant. Took the jib and staysail out of her, unbent the mainsail, which could t obtakein the boat. Took a cask of water and got back to the Island about 9 p.m. On the morning of the 29th April Mr Chapman, E Chapman, and myself, went off to the vessel and found she was on her beam ends with her weather side just awash. E. Chapman dived and cut the yard ropes of the main boom, and the main and fore gaffs. We towed them ashore. We removed some of the running gear and took it off to the island. On the 30th April I was making sails for the dingy, while Mr. Chapman and his son went to the vessel and brought ashore the jib-boom and part of the running gear. At the time the vessel struck it was ebb tide with a light wind from the N. W. ; Mr. Chapman was piloting us in, he having been there before ; we were stearing due E. straight for the Island. Mr. Chapman and his son left in the dingy on the 1st May, for Port Walcott They left on 11 30 a. m We then had two-thirds of a bag of flour and a'ioufc 6 gallons of water. On the 11th May we had some rain, and seeured about 12 gallons of water; on the afternoon of the lltb. the cutter Pilot arrived, and on the 13th we em- barked and sailed for Port Walcott, at which place we arrived on the morning of the 15th May. When we left the Mary Ann had drifted towards the Island about a mile, and was laying on a sandy bottom. I do not consider her a wreck.

The Mary Herbert.-Great anxiety is felt for the fate of the schooner "" Mary, Herbert,"" owned by Mr. J. Herbert of Fremantle. She left Albany for Fremantle three weeks since, and has not yet been heard of. Shortly after she left Albany, heavy Nor-west gales set in, and as she did not run back to Albany it is pre- sumed she has been driven as far Eastward as the Bight, and possibly the first news of her safety may reach us from South Australia.

Some anxiety is felt for the safety of the schooner Mary Herbert, from Adelaide to Fremantle. She left King George's Sound, nearly a mouth ago, and has not since been heard of.

ARRIVAL OF THE "" ORWELL"", NO NEWS OF ""MARY HERBERT.""The schooner ""Orwell,'' Captain Quail, from   Melbourne arrived in harbor Sunday evening at 6 o'clock ; she is laden with general cargo part for here, and part for Champion Bay. Captain reports leaving Port Phillip on the 2nd inst. but was immediately forced to run in under Kemp Island, and stay for two days during a severe gale. Had light fair winds half way across great Australian bight, when it came on to blow W. and N.W. gales, and continued so for 9 days ; fine weather followed and advantage was taken to work round through the out-lying rocks and reefs up to Cape Leuwin thereby considerably shortening the passage. During this time Captain Quail was continually on the look out at mast-head, the land was well in sight, and he had favorable opportunities of detecting anything unusual along the coast ; there was no sign of a vessel, or the wreck of one, no fires or smoke ; no signs of human beings or symptoms to indicate their having been there. Had the ""Mary Herbert"" driven   on to any part of this coast, the "" Orwell,"" in the passage she took round, could hardly have failed sighting her.
The schooner Rose caine into port on Sunday from Adelaide 27 days out, she encountered heavy westerly gales throughout ; her cargo consists of llour for the Commissariat Depart- ment and barley.

Fears are entertained that the schooner Mary Herbert, which left King George's Sound for Fremantle about eight weeks since, has foundered at sea.

No tidings have been received of the schooner Mary Herbert, from Adelaide, via King George's Sound, to Fremantle, reported as missing in our last summary. She has now been fifty six days at sea ; aud as the weather was unusually boisterous Boon after she left Princess Royal Harbor, the general sup position is that she has foundered, and that all on board have perished. Besides her enterprising owner — Mr. Herbert — there were several other passengers in the vessel, some of whom had relatives in this colony.

The Mary Herbert. — The discovery of wreckage on the coast to the eastward of Cape Leuwin, described in an official communication in another column, affords a clue to the probable fate of this unfortunate vessel. Many speculative opinions will be offered as to the   manner in which the ship was wrecked, but the true story of the catastrophe, we fear, can now never be told, since it is scarcely possible at this late day that a soul on board has been spared to relate it. A fact reported by Captain Miles, of the schooner Mary Ann, appears to favor the supposition that the Mary Herbert was not driven ashore and wrecked, but that she foundered in the open ocean. On the second day after her departure from King George's Sound, the weather then being very unsettled and boisterous, the Mary Ann, lying at anchor in Bremer Bay — some 120 miles to the eastward of Albany — was struck by a ""white squall"" from the westward, and     thrown on her broadside. The squall gave no warning whatever of approach, and lasted about twenty minutes. The con- sequences of a squall, of only half such force, striking a vessel like the Mary Herbert, in light draught as she was, under canvas, would doubtless be most dis- astrous. There were on board, on leaving Albany, besides Capt McKenzie and crew of seven, Mr. James Herbert, Mr. and Mrs. Hughes and family (4), and Messes. Crowdy and Oran.

Portions of wreck supposed to belong to the Mary Herbert have' been found on the South coast by a policeman employed by Government to search for traces of her. An examination of the wreck wood found shows that it did not belong to this vessel. Much sympathy is felt for Mr. Herbert's wife and family.

It had a standing bowsprit, one deck, a square stern, stern galleries and a woman figurehead (presumably of the queen after whom the vessel was named). Records show it underwent repairs in 1844 and 1848. The first owner was named Fairfield, but Thomas Sleddon owned it at the time it was wrecked. The Mary Queen of Scots had brought a cargo of guano from Shark Bay to Fremantle in January 1855, and after loading further cargo there it sailed to Port Gregory on 3 February 1855. It was then to continue on to Singapore.
On board were the master, Captain Baxey (Totty, 1979) or Captain Buxey (Henderson, 1988), 12 ticket-of-leave men, 15 prisoners under the charge of a constable (for the Geraldine Lead Mine), five passengers, two ostlers and a crew of thirteen. The cargo aboard the vessel included timber, shingles, flour and twelve horses. Also on board was a single fluked anchor consigned by the Harbour-Master at Fremantle to Henry A. Sanford to add to the permanent moorings at Port Gregory. The Leander and Preston had previously brought up mooring gear, but obviously this now needed to be supplemented. Mary Queen of Scots was to load 40 tons of lead ore at Port Gregory.
THE LOSS
The Mary Queen of Scots arrived at Port Gregory on 7 February 1855 after a 42-hour passage from Fremantle. It anchored ‘just at the tail of the reef on the southern side of Hero Passage where it felt the influence of the heavy current both from this and the Golddiggers Passage’ (CSO 339/6, quoted in Henderson, n.d., Research Notes). The barque went aground on a sandbank while still in the process of furling sails after the trip, but was refloated after hauling off with anchors and winch. The master, Captain Baxey, re-anchored in deeper water closer to the reef using two anchors and 25 to 30 fathoms of chain.
About 10.00 p.m. that night a gale developed and the anchors began to drag. No more chain could be veered for fear of the vessel swinging back onto the sandbank. Other vessels in the port left for the open sea, but Captain Baxey remained despite local advice to leave. At midnight the anchors had dragged so far that the Mary Queen of Scots went aground on the sandbank and began to strike heavily, fracturing the keel and starting a severe leak. The pumps were manned but made little headway against the flood of water pouring in.
The barque was now rolling excessively in the heavy surf that was breaking all around it. Several men were sent aloft to lower the topgallant masts and yards, but no sooner had they been sent aloft than they were ordered down again, as Mr Sleddon thought that the masts might snap and fall with the men still aloft. Blue lights were lit for assistance but were not answered until the early hours of the next morning.
A few hours after striking the sandbank there was 2.4 m of water in the hold and a fear of the horses drowning, so they were hoisted onto the deck. By 7.00 a.m. the crew started to throw them overboard hoping that they would swim to shore.
Henry Sanford, the officer in charge of the Lynton convict depot, tried to reach the vessel in a whale-boat but was prevented by the rough seas. He then swam to the ship and took charge of rescue attempts. Another attempt to reach the ship by whale-boat with a line from the shore was successful only because a seaman swam from the Mary Queen of Scots to the whale-boat with a line. With this line from ship to shore the crew were gradually taken off by ship’s boat, until that was dumped on the beach and stove in. After this a raft built on the ship was used. Thomas Sleddon, Captain Baxey, the first officer and Sanford finally landed ashore at 6.00 p.m.
While carrying out salvage operations Sleddon and the crew noticed that the fore part of the vessel was rocking one way while the aft section moved the other way. Three days later the vessel began to break up. On 13 February the mainmast came down and the barque went to pieces.
INQUIRY
The Resident Magistrate at Champion Bay, William Burges, in a letter to the Colonial Secretary put the cause of the wreck to mismanagement of the vessel, in particular the master’s choice of an unsafe position to drop anchor.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Eleven of the horses thrown overboard were later found ashore. On 12 February the weather abated sufficiently for the owner and crew to return aboard and salvage some of the cargo. This included a third of the timber, half of the shingles and six bags of flour. Some other articles that washed ashore, including a 5-gal keg of gin, were also recovered. The collapse of the mainmast on 13 February and the consequent tangle of rigging prevented anybody boarding the wreck until it broke up soon afterwards. Spars and some ship’s timbers washed ashore over subsequent days.
The hull, anchor and the items salvaged were sold at auction for a mere £80 to A. Clinch, and the four ship’s boats sold to Charles Evans for £20. The vessel was not fully insured, and Thomas Sleddon lost heavily, including having to pay duty on the keg of gin that washed ashore.
Henry Sanford lost two coils of whale line in the rescue. Whale line was a particularly high quality rope with great strength for its size and was consequently expensive.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Mary Queen of Scots has not been located, but the magnetic anomaly that has been found in line with a large anchor on the reef may possibly be the wreck of the barque. This anomaly is at present buried by the shifting sands within Port Gregory.
Sanford in a letter to his brother in Perth dated 12 March 1855 described the sequence of events of the wrecking, and his part in the rescue of the crew. His description of the position of the vessel at various times is important in attempting to locate the wreck:
…first Mr Sleddon, Capt. Baxey and Mr Evans tried all they could to make me sign the survey, that the vessel was wrecked and lying in the minor entrance of the harbour, she never was further than this (No. 1) and she dragged her anchors from (No. 2) and she was wrecked (No. 3)—(No. 4 my store). In the first printed charts you cannot see where she was wrecked. The chart not giving far enough to the Northward. The last I have not by me, but just look to the chart with my little sketch, and you can make the thing plain I think.—Now for my story.—I was absent when the vessel arrived in sight and did not know she was in sight until I found her aground at (No. 5). I went on board and we managed to nudge (kedge? author) her up to (No. 1). The Captain stating he had come close round the reef and dropped his anchor under the reef but that she had dragged her anchor to (No. 5)—getting off the bank and afloat (quoted in WAM File No. MA-117/80, vol 3).
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
The only known artefacts from the wreck of the Mary Queen of Scots include the ship’s bell that now hangs in the Northampton District High School. The headmaster and a teacher found it lying on the beach in the mid 1960s. A post at the north end of the lower verandah of the Lynton homestead is made from a spar from the Mary Queen of Scots, and for many years one of its masts was used as a footbridge at Bowes River Station. This was washed away during floods in the 1930s. In all probability local people would have quickly used any other spars and ship’s timbers washed ashore for building purposes.","NO","UK","13","","","4.70","N","117/80","N","N","","","28.70","","","","","499/1853","Sunderland","Fremantle","Liverpool","Singapore","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

"Mayfield","1945","Rocky Bay, Swan River","","","","","Y","5.00","","","","Originally built as an unpowered barge measuring 22m long and 5m across the beam, Mayfield was registered in 1899 and operated by the Swan Brewery Company. It was operated in conjunction with the paddle steamer Kentish Lass to transport beer from the brewery to the port, returning with sugar, hops and malt (Wellborn, 1987:79). In 1934, the barge was sold to a ferry operator named Tilly, who installed two engines, one powering a propeller, the other for a jib in order to operate independently (Cooper, 2012). As it is the case for many vessels of this kind, its history is relatively unknown, however during World War II, it was tasked to carried the armour plating shields of a 6 inch gun to Rottnest Island for the installation of the 9.2 inch naval guns at Oliver Hill battery (Scrimshaw, 1981:5). In 1945 it sank for reasons unknown in the Swan River at the base of the limestone cliffs on the western side of Rocky Bay, North Fremantle in a maximum depth of 5m. Its topmast visibly marked the location of the wreck for a number of years, until it eventually collapsed (Cooper, 2012).

Pickersgill","Captain Peter DIckson (?)","Captain William Walker","At anchor","Y","8.10","","Ballast","AUS 116","Mayflower (some sources list this brig as May Flower) was built under Special Survey by W. Pickersgill, with one deck and a round stern. It was copper fastened and sheathed with felt and yellow metal, and was launched in May 1867. The first owner was G. Lawson who sold it to Captain Peter Dickson of Adelaide in 1873 (registered Adelaide 31/1874). Dickson collected the vessel at London, sailed it to Antwerp and there loaded a cargo of dynamite for Adelaide and Melbourne. Over the next few years the vessel successfully traded between Australian ports, New Zealand, Mauritius and Cape Town. By 1880 it was jointly owned by five men; Peter Dickson (Sr) 13 shares, Peter Dickson (Jr) 13 shares, James MacGeorge 12 shares, Captain William B. Walker 13 shares and Alf Russell 13 shares. Under the command of William B. Walker, a part-owner, the Mayflower had departed Cape Town for Guam, an island destination often used by ships’ masters to hide their real objective, or sometimes when, without a definite destination, they went seeking cargoes in Asian ports.
THE LOSS
Anchored in Flinders Bay on 15 July 1880 the Mayflower was subject to south-south-east winds that produced squalls and rain. At 1.15 a.m. a heavy ground swell caused the vessel to touch bottom. All hands were called on deck and the jib, topmast staysail and main topmast staysail were set. Captain Walker was attempting to bring the vessel’s head more towards the east so as to get the port anchor down. This was successfully done at 3.00 a.m. and the brigantine was kept clear of the ground by heaving ahead on both anchors.
At daylight, after using the ship’s boat to lay out a kedge anchor, Walker sent a message ashore to obtain the use of a boat to assist in laying out a stream anchor. At 7.00 a.m. the Mayflower started bumping on the bottom again, and the stream anchor was laid out. With the wind freshening from the south and the heavy swell still rolling into the bay, the vessel was hove ahead on the kedge and stream anchors. At about 8.00 a.m. the pawls of the windlass carried away, so the anchor chains were secured to the fore and main masts. About 9.00 a.m. the windlass bitts also carried away, the pounding unshipped the rudder and the port anchor cable parted. The brig dropped astern and bumped even more heavily. At this stage there were 12 in (30 cm) of water in the pump well, which doubled within an hour to 24 in (60 cm). With the vessel striking heavily and starting the sternpost, even all hands manning the pumps could not prevent the water from gaining.
At midday another boat was hoisted out and the personal effects of the crew were taken ashore. Two hours later the Mayflower was abandoned as there was a danger of the masts going overboard. The crew landed at Augusta and the Mayflower became a total wreck on the southern edge of Deere Reef, some 750 m north of Barrack Point.
INQUIRY
The subsequent Court of Inquiry into the loss of the Mayflower found Captain Walker guilty of negligence in anchoring too close to the shore, and suspended his certificate for six months.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The wreck of the Mayflower was sold at an auction conducted by James Moore, held at the Vasse Hotel in Busselton at 11 a.m. on 4 August 1880.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Mayflower lies approximately 300 m offshore, 10 m from the seaward side of the southern section of Deere Reef.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The Mayflower wreck lies on a sandy bottom, with the main axis lying north-south. The 32 m long wreck site consists of iron deck supports, bronze bolts, timber, some unidentified ironwork and, at the southern end, the remains of the windlass with two sets of stud-link chain leading southwards.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
During a wreck inspection carried out by the Western Australian Museum in April 1981 a number of items were recovered from the site of the Mayflower. These included a rudder gudgeon, bolts, alloy sheathing, a spike, a sample of timber with a treenail, part of a chain plate and a broken vinegar bottle. The rudder gudgeon is now on display at the Augusta Historical Museum.","NO","UK","","1981/04","","4.90","N","2009/0164/SG _MA-8/81","Y","Y","-34.333102","","33.50","","115.171923","","","56115","Sunderland","Table Moutain","Port Adelaide","Guam","Aerial GIS","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., (2012).

"Mayhill","1895/08/10","Point Moore","","W.H. Myer of Liverpool","Captain Hume","Went aground on reef","Y","12.50","","2947 ton Railway iron","AUS 81","4-masted barque,  Hull:	Iron and steel Mayhill was built by A. Stephen & Sons at Dundee in Scotland in 1890 for George William Wood. He sold it to W. H. Myers & Sons, Liverpool, in 1893. The framing and stringers were of iron with plating and beams of steel. There were two decks, the upper deck being sheathed with wood. The vessel was under charter to the White Star Line of Aberdeen, carrying 2?947 tons of railway line for the Mullewa to Cue railway at the time it was wrecked. This cargo was insured for £15?000. The Mayhill was valued at £24?000.
Basil Lubbock says that the Mayhill was ‘one of the fastest four-mast barques built in 1890…she hardly ever made a bad passage’ (Lubbock, 1966: 116). The Mayhill’s best passage times were:
1891–92	Downs (UK) to Melbourne (Victoria)—74 days.
1892	Newcastle (NSW) to San Francisco (USA)—57 days.
1893	Newcastle (NSW) to San Francisco (USA)—50 days.
THE LOSS
The Mayhill sailed from Middlesborough, England, on 20 May 1895 for Geraldton. The vessel was under the command of Captain James Hume with 28 crew and one passenger. On 10 August the ship was just north of Champion Bay with a gale blowing and high seas. Captain Hume was attempting to sight two red lights in line to enter the deep water channel, which his 1881 copy of the sailing directory stated were in place. Unknown to him, these lights had been changed to white. These white lights were seen by Captain Hume, but ignored because they did not agree with his sailing directory. When he found the vessel was approaching too close to the breakers, he wore ship to go on the starboard tack but found it would not clear the rocks so he put the vessel about again. At about 6.30 a.m. the Mayhill struck the reef before it could come up into the wind. The vessel’s bow rode up onto the reef while big seas broke over the stern. A signal of distress was made when it was realised that the pumps could not handle the water entering the vessel.
Captain Hume asked for assistance from the Lindus, but the master of that vessel refused to imperil his ship. Captain Hume said later that he was of the opinion that he could have got the Mayhill off the reef with the aid of the Lindus, but as there was 1.8 m of water in the hold and the pumps were not coping with the influx, this opinion seems to have been over optimistic.
The first rescue boat, the Lillian and Maud, left Geraldton at 7.30 a.m. manned by the deputy pier master, Brede, water policeman Reichard, and a young man named Davis. This small cutter was struck by a very big sea and lost its mast within a couple of hundred metres of the wreck, and had to hurriedly rig a jury mast in order to get back to shelter. Some three hours later a bigger cutter, the Una (20 tons) went out. It could not lie alongside the barque due to the high seas, so it lay off on the end of a line. The Mayhill’s crew were transferred to the Una via the ship’s boat, and brought ashore. This operation was completed by 3.00 p.m. The Mayhill remained fast on the reef until it began to break up about fourteen months later.
INQUIRY
A preliminary inquiry was held at the Geraldton Courthouse on 17 August 1895. Two days later Captain Hume was charged with six offences arising from this inquiry, as follows:
1. That you, being the master did before proceeding neglect to supply yourself with directions for Champion Bay.
2. Incurred unnecessary risk and hazard in the navigation of Mayhill by trying to enter at night instead of laying off until daylight, having no knowledge of the Bay.
3. Guilty of gross negligence omitting to provide yourself with the latest issue of Admiralty List of Lights for the WA coast.
4. Guilty of gross negligence for not providing yourself with Admiralty chart No. 1723 called Houtman’s Rocks 1892 as lights on this chart show as white lights.
5. Guilty of gross negligence for not providing yourself with Admiralty chart No. 1725 called Champion Bay corrected 1882 superceding charts of 1877 which showed lights as red ones, which they were when first erected.
6. Guilty of gross negligence and acted in direct opposition to the caution issued by the Admiralty and Lloyd’s.
The findings were that in relation to charges 1, 3, 4 and 5 no blame was attached to Captain Hume. The Chief Harbour-Master of Fremantle, Captain Russell, corroborated Captain Hume’s explanation of being issued with outdated and incorrect charts, directories and other material. He stated that he too had received outdated charts and instructions from the Admiralty.
Charge 2 was upheld and the Court ruled that Captain Hume committed an error of judgment. His Master Mariner’s certificate was suspended for 3 months from the date of the wrecking, but he was permitted to use his Chief Mate’s certificate. Captain Hume was absolved of charge 6.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The day following the wrecking some members of the crew managed to board the Mayhill and with great difficulty got off the ship’s papers, log and a pet pig called Parnell. A few days later the sea had abated sufficiently for the crew to again board, enabling some personal effects and other useful items to be recovered.
Salvage work commenced almost immediately. The Commercial Union Insurance Co., insurers of the cargo, employed Symon, Hubble and Captain Fothergill of Fremantle to recover the railway line, and within two months over 400 tons had been taken ashore. Over the following five months a further 2?200 tons was removed. For much of this time the salvors lived aboard the wreck, going ashore when bad weather threatened. The railway line recovered was taken to Geraldton by lighters towed by SS?Dolphin, Captain W. Millar, with Mick Madden as engineer.
In July 1896 the wreck was sold for £53 and the remaining railway iron for £26. Salvage continued under the new owners, but by early October the vessel began to break up. About 100 tons of rails could not be recovered and remains on the wreck site.
SITE LOCATION
In 5 m of water on Point Moore Reefs, 400 m south-east of the entrance to the deep water channel into Geraldton Harbour.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The Wreck Inspection Report (Totty, 1983) states that the site lies on an axis of 030º bows to the north, and is largely flattened with only a few sections of the hull projecting above the sea floor.
There is no evidence of machinery, windlasses or anchors and the general indication is one of heavy salvage and an almost total lack of artefacts. The vessel’s floors are still evident throughout, and part of the cargo of railway lines is visible. The stem and stern are also distinguishable from the main wreckage and the curve of the stem and the jumble of mast sections nearby are very striking. The site is visually quite attractive and is spread over an area of 100 m by 20 m. It is accessible only on days with low to moderate swell, but when publicized could become a popular diving attraction in good weather.

THE VESSEL
Little is known of the vessel and the dimensions above are those given by Henderson (1980) for a barque called Mercury that was probably the Mercury that disappeared in 1833. This barque had a standing bowsprit, single quarter gallery and a bust figurehead. It was owned by Charles Bell of Calcutta and carried fourteen guns.
The Mercury was carrying members of a company that had been formed to buy land and settle in Western Australia. There were at least 80 people on board.
THE LOSS
The Mercury left Madras on 3 October 1833 (Moore, 1884), Calcutta on 8 October 1833 (Totty, 1979) or Calcutta on 3 October 1833 (Henderson, 1980) under the command of Captain Beadle (Totty, 1979) or Captain C. Cowles (Henderson, 1980). With no news of the ship by early 1834 concern was expressed, as the normal passage time was only one month. It was thought that it may have been wrecked on the Cocos Keeling Islands and HMS Hyacinth was sent to search there, but without success.
In mid 1834 rumours reached Perth of a shipwreck somewhere about 30 days walk to the north. Two Aborigines, Tangin and Weemat, brought down the story that a considerable amount of silver coinage lay on the beach near a wreck. All the crew were dead. The informants also said that the wreck had three masts standing, and that the masts still had sails on them. The wreck was supposed to have been seen some six months earlier. Tangin and Weemat had not themselves seen the wreck, but received the information from the Wayl men or Weel men in whose territory the wreck was lying. It is possible that the story referred to the earlier wreck of the Zuytdorp on the cliffs north of the Murchison River, as the times and distances described were very vague and open to interpretation. Playford believes that the name Wayl derives from an Aboriginal water well called ‘Wale’ situated 50 km north of the Zuytdorp wreck site (Playford, 1996, 213).
A few days later another Aboriginal informant, Moiley Dubbin, arrived in Perth and stated that some of the crew and passengers had in fact survived, and were living on the shore in five tents. These survivors included several white men of very large stature, and women with children. He reported that there were coins lying around on the beach and that the Weel men had also collected them from the surf. Moiley had not seen the wreck either, but was passing on information he also had received from the Weel men. Tangin, Weemat and Moiley said that they were afraid to travel in the territory of the Weel men, as they were cannibals.
George Fletcher Moore in his diary stated that Aborigines from the north had brought some British coins, including crowns and half-crowns, to Perth. On his suggestion an Aborigine named Weeip was sent north with a letter to any survivors. Weeip’s reward was to be that when he returned his son, who was in prison, would be set free. Moore believed that the wreck must be in the vicinity of Shark Bay because the Aboriginal informants described it as being ‘30 days journey’ north of the Swan River. In due course Weeip returned but without any contact having been made with survivors. He still persisted with the story of the coins on the beach, but perhaps he also may have been afraid of the Weel men and so repeated the coin story told by them to Tangin, Weemat and Moiley.
The Dutch colonial schooner Monkey was sent to search for survivors but without success; however, a considerable quantity of timber from a wreck was found in South Passage at the southern end of Dirk Hartog Island. This timber was described as ‘teak with some fir full of worm’. A further expedition was dispatched in November 1834 aboard the Colonial Schooner Ellen under the command of Lieutenant Derbishire, who had previously searched the Cocos Keeling Islands in HMS Hyacinth. This search was also unsuccessful.
In 1851 Aborigines from the Champion Bay area told of a shipwreck near the mouth of the Greenough River about sixteen or seventeen years earlier. Again the Aborigines spoke of a wreck with many drowned. Some doubt was therefore raised about the Shark Bay location that had been searched in 1834. It was reported in the Perth Gazette of 26 August 1851:
He [the captain of the Monkey] was sent to Shark Bay, the locality strangely believed to be indicated by the native description of its distance from the Swan, rather blundering calculation of 30 days native walk or 10 days white man’s ride, 500 miles!
As a result of the fresh report Lieutenant Benjamin Franklin Helpman in the brig Saucy Jack was sent to investigate. Although nothing could be seen on the beach in 1851, the Aborigines said that much wreckage had been covered by sand. Helpman found some burnt wreckage a little to the south of that river and this may have come from the Mercury. Pieces of wreckage were also picked up in Champion Bay. There is no evidence that these incidents and reports concern the Mercury, but it was conjectured at the time to be associated with the loss of that vessel.
INQUIRY
While the non-arrival of the Mercury caused much anxiety and speculation in the colony, no formal inquiry was held.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
During the very early years of the Swan River settlement, there were strong links formed with the British in India. Swan River was seen as a sister colony outside of the Indian sub-continent, a place where furlough could be taken amongst English speaking people and a place where children could be educated rather than sending them home to England.
To Europeans Australia was Terra Nullius and as such was seen as a place where land could be acquired and fortunes made, using cheap Asiatic labour. The Mercury was carrying a group of speculators who hoped to settle in Western Australia and establish trading ventures. Among the people on board were seventy natives of India destined to supply cheap labour.
In 1839 Grey discovered the river running into Champion Bay just north of Bluff Point and called it ‘Greenough’; by early in the 1850s Gregory’s identification of it as the ‘Chapman’ had become established. Owing to this confusion the wreckage referred to as possibly being from the Mercury may have been found a few kilometres north of Geraldton and not at the mouth of the present day Greenough River.

Doxford & Sons, Ltd as the Hallgyn, Norwegian owned and registered at Bergen. It was later sold to French owners, registered at Dunkirk and the name changed to Lina L.D. By 1944 it belonged to The Heirs of the late Michael J Goulandris  (Goulandris  Bros managers), and was registered in Greece. The ship had one deck and a shelter deck, a bulkhead on the shelter deck and five bulkheads below the main deck. The triple compound engine had cylinders of 27 inches, 44½ inches and 75 inches, with a stroke of 54 inches. There were three single-ended boilers operating at 180 lbs/square inch. A Direction Finder was fitted. This appears to be a sister-ship to the Castlemoor (see entry), launched in August 1922 with identical length, breadth, depth, engines and boilers, and also built by Doxford.
The Michael J Goulandris  had picked up a cargo of 7 000 tons of coal in Newcastle, NSW, and 2 000 tons of general cargo in Sydney.
THE LOSS
At 9.45 p.m. on 21 December 1944 the Michael J Goulandris struck the South West Reefs some 3½ miles south of D’Entrecastaux Point. The weather at the time was fine and the wind was reported as being force 4 (11-16 knots). The Port St John (Captain E.T.N. Lawrey), which was in the vicinity, was requested by radio from the Naval Officer in Charge at Fremantle to go to the assistance of the stricken vessel. It arrived at the wreck site at 4.40 a.m. on 22 December and succeeded in rescuing all the crew of the Michael J Galoundris. Captain Lawrey’s report stated:
No boats could be seen on the stranded vessel on the side visible to Port St John, and no communication could be established by daylight signalling, but men could be seen on board the stranded vessel, which appeared to be fast on the reef forward with swell breaking over her forepart. We lowered our motor boat, the Chief Officer in charge and by noon he returned towing the Greek lifeboat with the remainder of the crew and all their effects. The boats were hoisted in board with difficulty and by 1500 we left the scene and resumed our voyage.
The Chief Officer informed me that between his two visits to the stranded vessel, she was much deeper in the water and was grinding and working. The swell had increased and was breaking over the forepart of the stranded vessel with great force at times. He noticed that the wireless aerial and jumper stay had carried away and he had great difficulty in manoeuvring his boat near the wreck and in keeping her close to the side.
The position of the vessel when sighted was on S.W. Reef, 4 miles off D’Entrecastaux Point and appeared to be heading W.S.W., which heading had altered to the south when we left the vicinity at 1500 (quoted in Dickson, 2010:10).
The crew of the Michael J Goulandris  were subsequently landed at Bunbury.
INQUIRY
The Royal Australian Navy in Fremantle sent Commander C.J.R. Webb, RANR(S) retired, on board HMAS Dubbo to the scene of the wreck as Salvage Officer. His subsequent report stated that the Michael J Goulandris  was fast on the reef, facing in a direction of 230º. Dubbo could not approach closer than a mile to the wreck due to heavy seas, but Webb could see that the stricken ship was either lying in a crevice or had partly collapsed, as all that was visible above water was the funnel, a tall samson post or ventilator, the main mast and the heads of two other samson posts. The fore part of the vessel had broken away in the vicinity of the foremast. Webb concluded that the ship had struck while heading on a north-westerly course, and had then swung round to point south-west.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The sea was littered with flotsam and HMAS Dubbo collected a number of items including two inner tubes, a drum of petroleum jelly, two torpedo air chambers, a coil of rubber hose and a badly damaged Carley life boat. However, people from the surrounding area collected much more, and the police from a number of towns, together with Customs officers, were sent to request the return of goods taken from the beaches. The items recovered made a very long list, most of it domestic items, and obviously part of the general cargo:
Favourite brands of toilet and laundry soaps, American canned meats of several varieties, Milo in large and small tins, Glaxo baby food in large tins which we found to be excellent substitute for powdered milk, medical supplies, clothing, leather, paint, varnishes, Benzol in 44 gallon drums, sawn pine timber in various sizes, torpedoes and axe handles…As petrol was rationed and in very short supply, the first priority with vehicle owners was the Benzol. (Benzol at the time was used by tobacco growers as a fungus inhibitor in seeding trays.) Not knowing its suitability or otherwise for use in motor vehicles in it went with disastrous results. For the first few miles when used in the old “bombs” of the day they would take off like a rocket, but not for long. The Benzol having a high heat ratio and high octane rating soon blew up the weary old motors, or dissolved the rubberised fuel pump diaphragms. A few drums of Methylated spirits also came ashore and some tried it mixed with Benzol but to no avail. Later it was found that mixed with Power kerosene it wasn’t too bad (Moore, n.d.: 67).
There was also a quantity of torpedo parts that were recovered from various farms and towns. One of the most sought after items was some tanned leather, later used by one family to upholster their dining room suite. Not everything found was handed over to the police and Customs officials. One man handed in a small parcel of salvaged goods and received £3 10s 0d in salvage money. However, hidden in the bush in front of his house was a cache of:
240 small tins of Milo, 25 tins of Glaxo, 150 tins of assorted American meat, a large quantity of soap, numerous large tins of surgical Elastoplast, leather, paint, varnish, timber and many other sundries…It was a bad season for bushfires and: Every time a little puff of smoke went up everybody rushed out to see where it was in relation to their bush “plants” (ibid.: 68).
Many bales of raw rubber (a particularly valuable commodity during the war) were recovered by John Wellstead at Bremer Bay. These were sent to the authorities who later acknowledged Mr Wellstead’s contribution to the war effort. It is probable that these came from the wreck of the Michael J Goulandris . Despite being very heavy the bales evidently float, and the current close inshore along that part of the south coast sets to the east. A bale of the rubber was also found by staff from the Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum, while inspecting the wreck of the Harlequin near West Cape Howe.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Michael J Goulandris  lies on South West Reefs, three nautical miles south of Point D’Entrecastaux.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The Michael J Goulandris  lies scattered in depths of from 3 to 18 m of water, much of it in very rough surf on top of the reef. Few parts are recognisable except the boiler and a propeller shaft approximately 20 m in length.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
Tom Snider, an American submariner who had been put ashore at Fremantle for health reasons, obtained the salvage rights to the Michael J Goulandris (and other wrecks on the Western Australian coast). In 1960 he removed the propeller from the wreck.","NO","United Kingdom","","","","10.46","Triple compound steam engine of 577 HP","2012/0011/SG _MA-104/91","Y","N","-34.886029","","128.02","","115.992171","","","251","Sunderland","Sydney","Andros, Greece","Fremantle","Aerial GIS","Not protected Federal","Southwest Times 10/5/1959

There are two differing opinions as to the origin of the Midas. The Royal Gazette (the official government gazette of the Canadian province of New Brunswick) of 20 July 1847 lists a barque Midas departing New Brunswick for London on 18 July 1847. Watt also gives the registrations during this vessel’s life as: No. 406/1854 at the port of Liverpool, No. 71/1858 at the port of London, No. 39/1859 at the port of Melbourne, No. 29/1863 at the port of Melbourne, No. 4/1866 at the port of Sydney, and No. 4/1870 at the port of Dunedin. While Lloyd’s lists only a Midas built in 1847 on Prince Edward Island, and not one built in 1865, this is not definitive as many American-built vessels were not listed with Lloyd’s. The owner at the time it was wrecked was Charles Clark, ship chandler of Port Chalmers, New Zealand, who had acquired the vessel in 1870. The Midas was sheathed with yellow metal, and had a deck of New Zealand kauri, presumably replacing a worn or damaged deck during a refit after it arrived in New Zealand.
The Midas, under the command of John Cumming, sailed from Dunedin to Bunbury, arriving on 3 February 1872. This had been a long voyage of 98 days. At Bunbury a cargo of timber was loaded for Messrs Connor and McKay of Dunedin in New Zealand, which included about 100 jarrah piles each 21.3 m long and a quantity of sleepers. The timber was destined to be used in the construction of a large jetty at Dunedin for use in the timber trade between Western Australia and New Zealand.
THE LOSS
On 10 March 1872 a sudden storm struck the Bunbury anchorage. This was accompanied by a violent shift in wind direction, changing from the east, through north to west and then south. At its peak the wind blew hardest from the north for about two hours from 11.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m., and was described as a cyclone by the press. A newspaper reported that it was ‘unprecedented in the annals of this colony’ (Herald, 16 March 1872: 3f). The crew of the Midas immediately dropped a second anchor, but this proved insufficient to hold the vessel. With seas breaking over the deck, it dragged both anchors, with 90 fathoms (165 m) of chain on one and 75 (137 m) on the other. It was blown some 450 m into shallow water. Here the barque began striking heavily, carrying away the rudder and the mainmast at deck level. The mizenmast was chopped down to try to alleviate the strain on the barque. However, the port side had been bilged and the vessel quickly filled with water. At about 4.00 p.m. the wind began to gradually abate, too late for the Midas which was later condemned as a wreck.
Two coastal traders, the schooner Wild Wave and the cutter Twilight at anchor in the port, also went aground, both losing anchors and chains. The Wild Wave also lost its jib-boom while the Twilight had its rudder carried away (see entries).
INQUIRY
A Court of Inquiry held on 17 March 1872 found:
The court is of the opinion that the stranding of the barque Midas in the Port of Bunbury on Sunday the 10th March 1872 was caused by her dragging her anchors during a hurricane of unprecedented violence on this coast. And that no blame whatsoever attaches to Captain Cumming and the officers of the ship (CSR Vol. 727/35).
Captain Cumming returned to New Zealand on the brig Our Hope (237 tons), arriving at Otago on 20 April 1872.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The wreck and its cargo were sold at auction for £255 (Herald, 27 March 1872: 2d). When the anchors and chains were being salvaged they were found to be lying bunched together, and that the Midas ‘had laid so long in loading that she had let the 2nd anchor down on the other one and the 2 anchors and 96 and 45 fathoms were in a tangle, and it took a long time to clear them and stow them…’ (Withers, n.d.). The standing rigging was also removed, but the cargo could not be recovered due to the Midas deck remaining intact.
By March 1874 the wreck had become a navigational hazard, with the added danger of many floating jarrah piles from the cargo causing damage should the wreck break up in a storm. The Government therefore called for tenders to remove the wreck. The tender of W.F. Stevens for £487 was accepted (Government Gazette, 24 March 1874: 49). Stevens, using explosives to break open the wreck, recovered 200 sleepers, 27 piles, 30 fathoms (55 m) of 15/--8 inch (41.28 mm) chain, the iron work of the windlass, about one tonne of chain plates, bolts, and other iron, 40 iron knees and 0.25 tonnes of copper (CSR 813; Henderson, 1988:104). The timber cargo salvaged from the Midas was later shipped out on the James Hammell. A substantial portion of the Midas remained visible for many years until either natural sea bed movement or port developments covered it. A report from the Surveyor-General, Malcolm Fraser, dated 17 May 1875 states:
Mr Manning’s report says that nothing remains now but certain parts which stand from 12 to 18 inches above the sandy bottom, though the bottom of the wreck is presumably 6 feet below. About 1/3 of the starboard side remains and about 2/3 of the port side. Mr Manning also informs me that unless an experienced diver is employed it will be very difficult to do more than has been done…(CSR 813/109).
James Dagley Gibbs built a flat bottomed lighter of about 30 tons from the salvaged kauri deck timber of the Midas, which was then used to take cargo to and from vessels in Koombana Bay.
SITE LOCATION
The site of the wreck of the Midas is no longer known, but was stated in May 1875 to be 365 m east-south-east of a bend in the Bunbury Jetty (Henderson, 1988:104). A chart in CSR 813/117 shows the wreck as being about 12 chains (240 m) south-east of the outer end of the jetty.","NO","USA","","","","6.10","N","2010/0037/SG _MA-405/71","Y","N","-33.316548","","39.20","","115.644054","","","33205","Farmingdale","Dunedin","","Bunbury","On Historical map","Protected State","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

THE LOSS
The Mountaineer departed Albany on 14 March and sailed eastwards to continue sealing. Besides Jansen there were two crewmen, James Ward and Thilt, and five passengers. These were James Newell, his two sisters Dorothy and Mary, Mary’s husband Matthew Gill, and Mr Church-Owens. On 22 March the cutter anchored in Thistle Cove, and two days later it went ashore in a gale and was wrecked, everybody on board reaching shore safely.

ROEBOURNE, January 30.
Among the incidents or the past week the total wreck of the schooner Myra takes
a prominent place. The Myra was an old boat, having been built at Fremantle in
1875 for Messrs. Mackay.' She was built of wood. Her dimensions were-length 64ft.,breadth 17ft., and depth 7ft. 3in., with 52 tonnage. Shè had recently been trading for Mr. C. W. Paterson, between Balla Balla and Cossack, and on Sunday night last she sighted the latter place after making the customary trip. Mr. H. Bartlett was in charge of the boat, which carried a crew of
seven coloured men, and three passengers. The weather was squally, with a heavy sea from the north-east. On reaching the Reader Head the boat struck a rock known locally as Gravesend, and began to fill rapidly. The passengers pulled ashore, and the crew subsequently waded to the mainland. The accident is attributed to a heavy squall striking the vessel while in stays.

Purchased by pioneer pastoralist and entrepreneur Walter Padbury, under Captain Peter Hedlund (Hedland) the Mystery was used for first survey of Tien Tsin Harbour (also known as Port Walcott)  in 1863 conducted by Surveyor C.C. Hunt, and Mystery Landing later became the town site of Cossack, the first port in the north-west. Captain Hedlund also discovered Mangrove Harbour, later named Port Hedland. During this voyage the Mystery carried Aboriginal prisoners from Rottnest Island (Withnell-Taylor: 27-28)
In 1870 the Mystery was owned by Kenneth McLean, farmer of Port Walcott and was used in the pearling industry based out of Cossack. There is no record of the Mystery since 1870 and the Register was closed in 1908 (Parsons 1971).

"Naturaliste’s Chaloupe","1801/06/19","Cottesloe Beach","","","","","N","2.70","","Store","","Géographe and the Naturaliste were two corvettes under the command of post-captain Nicolas Baudin sent by the French Government on a voyage of discovery to the south-west, west, north-west and north coasts of New Holland in 1800. The Géographe carried a number of boats, but the biggest was the longboat, known to the French as a chaloupe. There is little information on the size of this boat. However there are at least two drawings of it from which some deductions may be made. The Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle at Le Havre in France has a collection of paintings and drawings from that expedition. Item number 16090 is entitled ‘Camp on an elevated coast’ (Bonnemains, et al. 1988: 112). This depicts a longboat heading in towards a rocky shore where there is a French camp. This boat has two masts on which are set what appear to be lateen or settee sails. Baudin states in his journal that his longboat was ‘easily distinguishable because of its sails’ (Baudin, 1974: 177). The boat has a high, arched transom and is shown with six oars. On board can be seen a number of people, one of whom is standing by the aft mast.
There is another drawing/etching, held in the Musée de la Marine, Paris, which shows the Naturaliste arriving at Kupang in Timor, with the Géographe already at anchor. Alongside the Géographe is a longboat with two masts, each having furled lateen or settee sails. This boat has a man standing near the stern, and a good idea of the size of the boat can be seen from its relationship both with this person and with the corvette alongside. Driven ashore, this chaloupe was refloated afte rextensive repairs..","NO","France","","","","1.20","N","","N","N","","","89.00","","","","","","","Ship","","Shore","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

The Nautilus is described as a yacht belonging to the firm of Broadhurst, MacNeil and Company. William Alexander Chamberlain of Fremantle built it and a photograph indicates a sloop-rigged vessel having a straight bow with a short bowsprit, and a counter stern. There is a foredeck from the bow to the mast, but it is open abaft of the mast. A very similar vessel built by Chamberlain in 1888 ‘after the style of the Nautilus’ (WA, 3 September 1888, in Dickson 1998: 55) was constructed of jarrah and kauri planking on American elm frames. The decks were kauri, some fittings in teak, and with brass pumps.
THE LOSS
While anchored at Gun Island a strong gale from the north-east caused the Nautilus’ cable to part and the yacht was driven onto the reef and wrecked.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
The Nautilus was one of the vessels owned by Broadhurst interests when the family were engaged in the guano industry at the Abrolhos. It was probably not used as a guano carrier, but more likely as a general purpose vessel.

With approval from Government Resident  Scholl, local pearlers and pastoralists led a number of retaliatory expeditions against the Jaburura between February and May 1868, which led to the series of events known as the Flying Foam massacres, with estimates of between 15 and 150 Aboriginal people being killed. The Flying Foam massacres were a key factor in the population decline of the Jaburura people who previously lived among the islands of what is now known as the Dampier Archipelago.","NO","","","","","","N","","N","N","","","","","","","","","Penguin Creek","","Fremantle","","","Protected Federal","The Perth Gazette and West Australian Times (WA : 1864 - 1874), Friday 3 April 1868, page 2, 3","","","","","1667","Wooden","Fisheries","pearling","Shipwreck","North West (Port Hedland Area)"

"Neck Bremen","1898/12","Scorpion Bight","","Gildemeister and Ries","","Wreckage found, possibly  Neck missing since April 1896","N","11.30","","","","The ship Neck was built of iron at Vegesack on the River Geeste, Germany, for the firm of Gildemeister & Ries of Bremen and registered in that port. It had two decks. The Lloyd’s Register of 1896-97 contains the notation ‘Missing since April 1896’.
There is no evidence that the wreck of the Neck occurred in Western Australian waters, but it is included in this book as it is one of the mysteries of the sea that came to light in this State.
THE LOSS
On 6 December 1898 the acting telegraph station manager at Eyre sent a telegram to the Post-master General in Perth, R.A. Sholl:
Reported last evening that upper part of deck-house, bearing name of Neck, Bremen, washed ashore, Scorpion Bight, twenty-eight miles east. Not been beached more than a day when discovered on 3rd inst. (quoted in West Australian, 7 December 1898: 4h).
A few days later the local Eucla newspaper reported:
Another of those painful uncertainties with which ocean life is unfortunately so closely allied has been brought to notice by a discovery made by Mr J.W.W. Graham at Scorpion Bight, 28 miles east of Eyre, of a considerable quantity of wreckage consisting chiefly of the upper part of a deckhouse and attachments. The name “Neck Bremen” is done in raised woodwork on each end of the structure, the dimensions of which are about 11 feet long by 9 feet wide. When found it had only been ashore for a day or two at most. Being made of teak throughout it is impossible to conjecture the length of time it has been in the water. No wreckage belonging to this vessel was found at any other point than the one mentioned, nor any evidence to show whether the vessel to which it belonged was a steamer or sailer (Eucla Recorder, 10 December 1898: 6a).
There is a gap of two and a half years from the time the Neck was posted missing until the deckhouse and other wreckage was found at Scorpion Bight. It was considered to have been ashore for only a day or two, but there was no way of ascertaining how long it had been in the sea. It would appear, however, that the deckhouse had not been submerged for any great length of time or this would have been commented on in the report. Even teak will show considerable evidence of deterioration if it remains underwater for a year or two.
There are a number of possibilities regarding where the vessel was wrecked. With the combined currents flowing in the southern Indian Ocean and Southern Ocean from west to east, any floating material from a wreck which occurred anywhere east of the Cape of Good Hope could be carried as far to the east as Scorpion Bight or even further. This current (part of the Indian Ocean Gyre) has an average rate of half a knot. If the Neck was wrecked on one of the islands in the Southern Ocean such as Prince Edward, Amsterdam, St Paul or the Crozet islands, a lot would depend on how long it took for the deckhouse to break away from the iron hull before it started drifting. Another possibility is that the ship was overwhelmed by one of the storms common in those waters, and that subsequently the deckhouse broke loose and with other wreckage drifted to Scorpion Bight.
Although the report states that no other wreckage was found but that at Scorpion Bight, there are many isolated sections of the south coast of Western and South Australia where material may have come ashore and never been found.","NO","Germany","","","","7.00","N","102/91","N","N","","","66.10","","","","","","Vegesack","","Germany","","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

 Neptune was initially owned by George Shenton who used it to lighter cargo from the ships anchored in Fremantle’s outer harbour to wharves along the Swan River. It was sold to Charles Edward Broadhurst in 1885. He employed the vessel carrying supplies to the Abrolhos Islands, returning with cargoes of guano. Broadhurst mortgaged the cutter to John Bateman in September 1885 for £500 at 8%. The mortgage was discharged in June 1893 when ownership was transferred to Broadhurst’s son, Florance Constantine Broadhurst. The transfer resulted from the son buying the business from his father who then retired to England. The younger Broadhurst continued to use the vessel on the Geraldton to Abrolhos run and was the owner at the time it was wrecked.

THE VESSEL
The American whaler North America was a ship-rigged vessel, having two decks, a square stern and a billet head, and was owned by William Wheeler. It had sailed under the command of Captain Kempton with a crew of 25 from Wilmington, Delaware, on 6 December 1839. The ship had made at least one previous voyage to Australian waters. The North America was at anchor in Koombana Bay along with two other American whalers, the Samuel Wright (Francis Coffin) and the Hudson (Captain J. Denison).
THE LOSS
On 6 July heavy rain during the day was followed on 7 July by mild gentle weather. However that evening the breeze freshened from the north-east, increasing and shifting north-north-east. ‘At midnight it blew a perfect hurricane’ (Perth Gazette, 18 July 1840: 3d). About sunrise on 8 July the wind shifted to the north, and at 8.00 a.m. went to the north-north-west and blew with ‘unmitigated fury’. The North America was blown onto the shore shortly after the Samuel Wright (see entry). It was ‘much damaged’ (Perth Gazette, 18 July 1840: 3d), being bilged the second time it struck. The storm quickly subsided and by 4.00 p.m. there was a gentle breeze blowing from the south. The Hudson had ridden out the storm safely on four anchors, and in fact went whaling the following day, catching one whale in Geographe Bay.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The Perth Gazette for 18 July 1840 published the following advertisement on its front page:
Two Wrecks For Sale
Sale of the Wrecks of the
Samuel Wright
and
North America
at Port Leschenault
On Monday 20th Inst.
The Samuel Wright (Capt. Coffin) and North America (Capt. Kempton), as they now lie wrecks, in the Port of Leschenault, will be sold on the above date, with all their sails, rigging, &c, &c.
Leschanault, July 9
The North America was bought by John Randall Phillips for £400, which included the whale-boats and whaling gear. The auction was conducted by Henry Bull, the Resident Magistrate at Bunbury. Phillips became resident magistrate at Albany in September 1840, and it is possible that he wanted to either use the whaling gear to set up a bay whaling station in the Albany area, or to sell it at a profit to whalers there.
Whale oil and bone salvaged from the wrecks of the Samuel Wright and the North America were also sold. The 30 tuns of sperm oil fetched £50 per tun, the 36 tuns of black oil £9 per tun and £90 per ton was paid for the 1½ tons of whalebone. The monies raised by the sale of the oil and bone were to be paid to the crews of the two ships in accordance with their lays.
E.H. Withers arrived in Bunbury in 1864 aged 7 years, and in his reminiscences he records that as a boy he salvaged copper bolts from the wreck of the Samuel Wright and one of the North Americas in order to sell them locally for 4 pence per pound weight. These bolts were about 600 mm long and 25 mm in diameter.
SITE LOCATION
On 27 December 1841 HMS Beagle sailed in to Koombana Bay to collect ‘Mr Forsyth [Charles Codrington Forsyth], whom I had sent over land’ and who had ‘completed the survey of this anchorage, and Leschenault Inlet, which it joins in the south corner by a narrow boat channel’ (Stokes, 1969: 395). Commander Stokes goes on to note ‘the wreck of a large whale ship in the head of the bay shows the folly of attempting to ride out the winter gales to which it is exposed…’. This wreck would most probably have been that of the Samuel Wright, which was quite prominent for some years after wrecking. The fact that Stokes does not mention the wreck of the North America suggests that Phillips had by this time substantially dismantled that wreck.
It should be noted that in the sailing directions prepared by Wickham and Stokes mention is made of two wrecks, the Samuel Wright and the North America (1840):
Point Casuarina is the southern point of a small opening, known as ‘Port Leschenault,’ from which a reef extends about a third of a mile to the N.N.W., and shelters the anchorage from the westward—this does not appear to be a very secure port, as when we passed in the Beagle at a wide distance from Point Casuarina, two American whale ships were lying on the beach having been driven from their anchorages a short time before, during a N.W.erly gale (Wickham & Stokes, 1842: 131).
These Sailing Directions, though dated 1842, would have been based on surveys carried out during the previous two years. Stokes’ chart of 1841 shows only one wreck. As this was probably the Samuel Wright, this further suggests that the North America (1840) had been dismantled after it was sold.
The Reverend Wollaston’s map drawn on 18 April 1843 depicts only the Samuel Wright and the second North America wrecked only eight days earlier, which reinforces the suggestion that the North America (1840) had virtually disappeared as a landmark.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The site of this wreck is not known. Magnetometer surveys undertaken by the Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum, in 1982 produced anomalies at a number of different sites, one of which may possibly be the scant remains of the North America (1840). These surveys, and reports by local residents, indicate that it is buried under metres of sand well inland from the present shoreline.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
SOCIAL (3)
Most of the crews of the three American whalers wrecked in July 1840 were subsequently engaged in bay whaling in the area. The Americans were sought after as crew because of their experience in whaling.
The North America had previously fished the southern coast of Australia, and in its very speedy twelve month voyage June 1838 to June 1839 had returned to the United States with 2 400 barrels of right whale oil, valued at about US$24 200.
REPRESENTATIVE (8)
The North America is representative of the multitude of American whaling vessels which worked along the south and west coasts of Western Australia in the 19th century.

THE VESSEL
The North America was ship-rigged and had two decks and a billet head. It was owned by Driscoll and Child, who had it insured for $8?000 in New Bedford, and the same sum in New York (Henderson, 2007: 268). It had departed on a whaling voyage on 12 June 1842 under the command of Captain Grinnell. By April 1843 when it arrived at Koombana Bay it had 500 barrels of whale oil on board.
THE LOSS
The North America was at anchor in Koombana Bay, having let go only one anchor and not lowered its topgallant and royal masts. (It was normal practice to lower the upper masts to reduce windage while a vessel was at anchor. In the event of severe weather the reduction in height of the masts also greatly reduced the strain on them and their standing rigging when the vessel rolled.) The wind had been easterly, but during the afternoon of Monday 10 April 1843 a squall of wind and rain brought the wind round to the north-east. About 7.00 p.m. this wind began to blow ‘in gusts with great violence, and between 8 and 10 the violence of these gusts increased to a perfect hurricane. Their fury was irresistible. The tide rose 4 ft, then in the course of 20 minutes fell 2 ft’ (Inquirer, 26 April 1843: 4b).
The North America began to drag its single anchor, so a second anchor plus the kedge anchor were let go. The kedge anchor went down foul and, as the vessel continued to drift, it struck on the east end of the bar at the entrance to Leschenault Inlet and there grounded. The newspaper report stated that while the vessel was drifting the crew ‘lost all self-possession when it began to drive, and were in a state of mutiny. The master could scarcely prevent them from taking to the boats’ (Inquirer, 26 April 1843: 4b).
When dawn broke on the Tuesday morning the ship was fast, but still had all its masts standing.
On Wednesday morning (12 April 1843) the crew of the North America hove up the first anchor, which proved to be twisted and with a broken shank. The second anchor which had been put down was also broken, but using it and the kedge the ship was hove off the bar into three fathoms (5.5 m) of water. As nothing was done that day regarding replacing its anchors, the North America again drifted back to the bar, this time going over it to become stranded on the beach, where it lay with apparently little damage.
Captain Daniel Scott purchased the wreck of the North America at an auction held on 15 May 1843, and, over the next month using anchors brought down from Fremantle, managed on 14 June to haul it off and back over the bar with little further damage. The Reverend Wollaston noted in his diary:
The person who bought the wreck of the North America (Mr Scott of Fremantle) has succeeded in getting her off the Sands, by hauling upon anchors he brought down with him, & she is now riding at anchor in our bay, not much the worse, I am told, for the accident. The Americans themselves might have done this, had they been properly found, & all this loss (to them) saved. However, it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good, & the purchaser will make sufficient profit by the late Gale. This is all in favour of our Port (Bolton, et al. 1992: 116).
Scott wished to register the vessel as a colonial ship. This was refused, and a little while later, on 10 July 1843, the ship was blown ashore again, this time permanently. It finished on its side, the bottom stove in, and lying not far from the wreck of the Samuel Wright. The press reported:
The unfortunate North America, which by enterprise of our brother settler Captain Scott, was got off the beach three weeks ago, is again on shore. On the evening of Monday, the 10th inst., it blew strong, and a heavy sea set into the anchorage, but yet the gale was not of that volume as to occasion any apprehension either for the North America or the Water Witch which was also at anchor in the bay. About 12 o’clock at night however, she parted from her anchor and went gently on shore near her old birth [sic], where, we lament to add, she lies on her side, and has the appearance of having her back broken. We do not pretend to know the cause of her cable being separated from the anchor. One statement says that the anchor had no ring when let down and that the chain cable was attached to it by a clove hitch which slipped by the jerk occasioned by the heavy seas. Another statement is that the chain cable snapped close to the anchor; as the ship dragged on shore with her 175 fathoms [320 m] of it which was nearly its whole length (Inquirer, 26 July 1843: 3a).
The press also reported that had the ship not been driven on shore by the gale it would have to have been beached, as it was more seriously damaged than previously thought. It was making more water than the pumps could cope with. The Reverend Wollaston considered Captain Scott’s loss to be not less than £500, which included his initial purchase cost, the expenses of getting the North America afloat and repairs including making a new rudder (Bolton, et al. 1992: 140).
INITIAL SALVAGE
Scott began to dismantle the wreck of the North America, loading the timber and shooks of barrel staves onto the schooner Elizabeth. Also loaded were 32 casks of whale oil which had been purchased by Luke Samuel Leake. On 17 November 1843 another gale struck, and the Elizabeth (see entry) was driven ashore and wrecked, nothing being saved except some of the casks of oil.
The Reverend Wollaston’s boat, then at Bunbury, was used to drag for the anchors lost from the North America and the schooner Chance (see entry), which had slipped its anchors and gone aground in the same storm. He complained of the damage done to his boat, which was taken without his permission (Bolton, et al., 1992: 75).
At the auction held on 15 May 1843 the Reverend Wollaston paid £1.15.0 for the ship’s bell for his church at Picton, and he also bought some flour and pork from what had been the ship’s stores.
SITE LOCATION
On 18 April 1843 the Reverend Wollaston traced a map of Bunbury originally drawn by Henry Mortlock Ommaney, assistant surveyor to John Septimus Roe, who had earlier surveyed Bunbury. Among other things, Wollaston marked on it the position of both ‘the North America ashore’ and the ‘wreck of ship Samuel Wright’. The map places the North America about 160 m north-east of the Samuel Wright. It also seems to depict the North America as a new wreck with its masts apparently little damaged, as all three masts are standing and have a reasonable correlation to their original height ratios. The Samuel Wright on the other hand is shown with only one mast and a shortened bowsprit, so it may be assumed that his map illustrates the North America wrecked only eight days previously.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The site of the wreck of the North America is now buried many metres under sand and lies in a carpark at approximately the latitude and longitude given above. When first uncovered by mining operations in 1963 the wreck was found to be lying in an approximately east-west direction close to the wreck of the Samuel Wright.
The North America was badly damaged as it was driven ashore for the third time, and was subsequently in the process of being dismantled over the second half of 1843. EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
The mining company collected a number of artefacts including an axe head, tryworks bricks, a sheave and the bowl of a clay pipe. When the Museum was called in they excavated the site and recovered more bricks, fragments of glass bottles, plate, copper nails and a considerable quantity of rusty iron. The site was later reburied.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
TECHNICAL (2)
Whaling vessels were noted for their robust construction. The North America was driven ashore three times within a comparatively short period, but only on the third occasion did it become a complete wreck.
SOCIAL (3)
A Perth newspaper decried the lack of seamanship of Captain Grinnell and crew:
It is lamentable that, from such neglect, and the bad equipment of the ship, discredit may be thrown on Port Leschenault, which it does not deserve. If the ship had been well found, and had made snug her masts and yards, she would have rode [sic] out the gale, notwithstanding its violence was that of a tornado; and after her accident, she might have got into deep water and security with common exertion. She will probably now be a wreck (Inquirer, 26 April 1843: 4b).
INTERPRETIVE (6)
Lying close to the Samuel Wright, the North America is included in the interpretive plaque erected in the car park to commemorate both American whalers.
REPRESENTATIVE (8)
The North America is representative of the multitude of American whaling vessels which worked along the south and west coasts of Western Australia in the 19th century.

THE VESSEL
The Northumberland was ship-rigged, and owned by Richard Davis and Sons of Menai Bridge, Anglesey, Wales. It was fastened with iron, and had been sheathed with felt and yellow metal. The ship was owned by Messrs Davies and Son of Menai Bridge. Under the command of Captain John Humphrey with a crew of 22 the ship departed Newcastle-on-Tyne for Albany on 2 March 1868. The cargo consisted of 1 727 tons of coal for the P&O Steam Navigation Company at Albany, and the vessel was only partly insured. It had been surveyed just prior to leaving England.
THE LOSS
On Sunday 14 June the Northumberland was south-west of Cape Leeuwin when it was struck by a severe gale from the north-north-east. By the following day the gale had increased to such an extent that all sail had to be taken in. By 10.00 p.m., despite having no sails set, the ship was on its beam ends, and with its lee rail ‘three to four feet under water, spars, that were all lashed on the leeside, broke their lashings, and floated over the lee-rail, doing the ship considerable damage before they went’ (South Australian Advertiser, 6 July 1868: 2). The following morning the centre of the storm passed over the ship, the direction of the wind then veering to the south-west. As this was blowing the Northumberland towards the coast the reefed foresail was set, but the wind blew it completely to pieces. The vessel, fighting extremely heavy seas, was leaking badly even though all hands were at the pumps it continued to take in water. Eventually the foretopsail was set, enabling the ship to be steered away from the coast. The Northumberland had a list and had settled lower in the sea.
Despite continuous pumping from the crew, by midnight on 16 June there was 3 m of water in the hold. The wind, which had been lessening, backed around to the north and freshened again to a strong gale. The ship continued to labour heavily. Around noon on 18 June the wind again began to moderate, but at 2.00 p.m. it veered rapidly to the south-west. The lower fore and main topsails were set in an effort to keep the ship heading to the eastward, but they were both blown out of their boltropes by a powerful gust. From then until midday the following day the Northumberland lay with the sheer poles in the water. All hands continued at the pumps, often being washed from them by the seas. ‘Every movable article on the starboard side of the ship had been washed away, forecastle and forehouse completely gutted; even the bunks were all washed away’ (South Australian Advertiser, 6 July 1868: 2).
The water had gained on the pumps, there being an extra foot (0.3 m) in the hold. Two lower topsails were bent on and the Northumberland steered towards the land, sighting West Cape Howe at 1.00 p.m.. This heading was kept until 4.00 p.m. when the course was directed along close to the coast in order that lives might be saved if the ship foundered. By this time there was 15 feet (4.57 m) of water in the hold, and with so much water in it the vessel (which was nearly on its beam ends) ‘was all but unmanageable’ (Inquirer, 8 July 1868: 3b-c). At 10.00 p.m. land was sighted ahead and the Northumberland tried to steer away, but it then struck a reef off Bald Head. The ship did not stop, striking again as it passed over the rocks, but losing the rudder as it went. The ship’s head was canted to seaward, and ‘directly afterwards opened the light on Breaksea Island, which had been previously masked by Bald Head (South Australian Advertiser, 6 July 1868: 2).
I now gave up all hope of saving the ship; stopped the pumps, got the boats, and got into them with what clothes we could get hold of; water at that time over the lower deck beams. Laid under the lee of the ship till towards morning, when I left in hope of getting some assistance, and landed on Breaksea, and the lightkeeper hoisted the signal of distress, which brought the Harbour-Master off, but too late, for about 9 the ship foundered in a line between Cape Vancouver and Breaksea Island, distant from the latter about eight or nine miles…(report by Captain Humphrey, quoted in South Australian Advertiser, 6 July 1868: 2).
According to an item in the Western Mail, the Northumberland, after striking the reef and losing its rudder ‘drifted to Rock Dunder, struck it, and sank in deep water (Nathaniel William McKail quoted in Western Mail, 27 January 1927: 17b). McKail, born in 1850, was 18 years of age at the time the ship was wrecked.
The Northumberland went down head first, with nothing left floating to indicate the exact position where it sank. The two boats in which the crew had abandoned the ship were commanded by Captain Humphries and the 2nd mate, the 1st mate being too ill. The boats initially landed on Breaksea Island, from where the harbour master towed them into Princess Royal Harbour as the crew were completely worn out with the incessant pumping. At 4.00 p.m. they arrived in Albany where seven of them were subsequently hospitalised.
The captain and 14 of the crew of the Northumberland travelled to Melbourne on board the RMS Bombay (1 186 tons, Captain George Nelson Hector), arriving on 6 July, while seven (most probably those hospitalised) went to Adelaide on the Australian Steamship Navigation Company’s steamer Rangatira (Captain Grainger) at a cost of £44.2.0 for their passage. The first mate, John Thomas, had been off duty sick for 14 days during the struggle to reach Albany prior to the loss of the ship. On arrival he was found to be so exhausted that he remained in Albany and was not expected to recover.
INQUIRY
A Court of Inquiry was held on 26 June 1868 at the Albany Court House before Sir A.T. Cockburn Campbell, Resident Magistrate, with Charles Louis Van Zuilecom and the harbour-master, George T. Butcher, as nautical assessors. The inquiry found that no blame could be attached to the master regarding the loss of the Northumberland.
It was pointed out by the inquiry that the means of signalling between the lighthouse on Breaksea Island and the pilot station at the entrance to Princess Royal Harbour was defective. It recommended that a semaphore or some other more effective means should be adopted. The recommendations continued with:
We also further recommend gathered from the opinions of several nautical men frequenting this part more materially confirmed by two officers of high standing of H.M.R.N. who recently visited this Port that a light should be placed at the extremity of the land off Bald Head, as a vessel making the land to the westward, and close in there is entirely excluded from the benefit of the light on Breaksea Island until Bald Head is cleared. We are also of the opinion that in order to distinguish it from the light on Breaksea a red light visible some 8 or 10 miles from the first point round by south to N.E. is most desirable (quoted in MA 195/72).
In a letter dated 28 January 1869 the Board of Trade in Whitehall rejected the proposed idea of a lighthouse on Bald Head.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The only items saved from the wreck of the Northumberland were a case containing reflectors for lighthouses and the two ship’s boats in which the crew had abandoned the ship:
One of these boats was for many years used as a passenger boat; the other was bought by my people for pleasure purposes. A Mr Harris, whose grandson is now Harbour Master at Albany (a member of one of the old families) bought the first boat. Both boats every year took part in the Albany regattas (Nathaniel William McKail quoted in Western Mail, 27 January 1927: 17b).
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Northumberland has not been found. However the search area can be narrowed slightly by combining Captain Humphrey’s statement that it sank in a line between Cape Vancouver and Breaksea Island, distant from the latter about eight or nine miles, with the harbour master’s statement that at dawn from the mainland he had seen a vessel between Michaelmas and Breaksea islands and about eight miles to the eastward of the latter. He pulled off in the pilot boat at 8.00 a.m. for Breaksea Island, noting that the ship, which he had thought to be a whaler, was still there. When nearing the island he noted that the ship had disappeared. 
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
There is a Northumberland Rock marked on some charts just south of Bald Head, and is presumably the place on which the Northumberland struck.
ARCHAEOLOGICAL (4)
When found the wreck of the Northumberland will provide information on mid-19th century wooden sailing ship construction. Being in relatively deep water and with nothing having been salvaged, it may provide many artefacts giving an insight into the lives of the officers and crew.

The 1168 ton wooden ship Northumberland was carrying a cargo of coal from Newcastle, England for the P&O Company’s coal depot in Albany, with 22 crew on board. After being strained in a severe storm, the ship started taking on water and the crew manned the pumps. Nearing land five days later and with eleven feet (3.3 metres) of water in the hold, the exhausted crew believed they were in imminent danger of sinking. At 10pm on 20th June 1868 they struck a reef off Bald Head and broke the rudder. As the ship drifted past Bald Head two minutes later the crew saw the light of the Breaksea Island lighthouse, and took to the ship’s boats, tying off to their stricken ship while waiting for daylight. The Northumberland stayed afloat until daybreak, and the crew went to Breaksea Island to alert the lighthouse keeper to raise the distress signal, but while they were on the island the Northumberland sank in a line between Breaksea Island and Cape Vancouver.
The site of the Northumberland has not been located and would lie in between 50-60 metres depth. The reef off Bald Head that the ship struck was subsequently named Northumberland Rock.","NO","UK","22","","","7.30","N","1034/2619","N","N","","","55.10","","","","","50568","Liverpool","Newcastle","Liverpool","Albany","*check Co-ordinates 1' off","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

"Occator","1856/02/09","Around 55 kilometres south of the Cape at Carbaddaman Passage","","G. and R. Barclay","Captain Place","On reef","N","6.20","","Ballast","A 329","Occator
In January 1856 the 27.2 metre, 145-ton brigantine Occator left Melbourne  to examine reportedly rich  guano deposits on the Muiron Islands off  North West Cape. Chartered by J. F. Jones of Melbourne, who also was a passenger on board, by the afternoon of   4 February, Occator was at an estimated 80 kilometres west of the Cape. Her master Captain Place then set a course towards the east, expecting to sight land in the morning. Around  midnight Place went below leaving the mate at the helm. At about 3.30a.m. somewhere in  the region of Carbaddaman Passage, breakers were sighted and as the helm was put hard over Place came on deck, seeing the vessel ‘in stays’ i.e. not coming around. After giving orders to haul the yards round, the vessel began to head back out to sea, but as she did so her  keel touched and a heavy sea broke over the deck and threw  the Occator onto the reef, damaging the hull. With water rising in the hold and the rudder unshipped the crew began to abandon ship.
The first boat launched was destroyed by the seas. This forced the crew to send off  the longboat in which the mate, Jones and four crew went ashore.  Three others in the crew  remained onboard and Captain Place went below for provisions. On the boat's return, reasonably well-provisioned and with some navigation equipment, they all departed the stricken ship. When they regrouped the ten men sailed  an estimated  90 kilometres north to Muiron Island, where they expected to find another vessel. After four days, and with no relief in sight, they elected to return to the wreck for more water. In being unable to launch the boat due to the topography and conditions, they dragged it nearly 3 kilometres across the island.  After finding a suitable place on the eastern side, they then set of south towards the wreck.
After proceeding down the coast they found that a group of ‘about 40’ Aborigines  were following the boat down to the wreck. While all went well initially, they reacted angrily when a cask of water that had been washed ashore was  put into the boat. They then followed it out, armed with stones and spears. When the water got too deep about ten of them began swimming after the boat apparently with the intention of seizing it. A spear was thrown without causing any injury while ‘others cast stones with slings’. Jones then shot one man, causing  the Aborigines to retire to the hills where they lit a fire.
The crew then departed for Shark Bay  taking  eight days  to get to Dirk Hartog Island where they lived for around a month on crabs, wallabies and drinking turtle blood as a substitute for water. After unsuccessfully trying to depart for Fremantle,  they crossed over to what they thought was the mainland with the intention of walking to safety. On returning to Dirk Hartog Island, 42 days after they had been wrecked,  they saw the schooner Favourite at anchor off Bird Island where they had been collecting guano and were saved.  The wreck has yet to be found.
 In June 2004  a Mr Albert Gorman reported an acquaintance he called  ‘the Yank’  finding what appears to have been an iron knee 10 feet long, by 6 inches wide by 3 inches deep  with a ‘bronze fastening at the ‘drop off’ north of Yardie Creek  and at a place he described as ‘south past the homestead near where the reef comes within 200m of shore.  As  Occator, which was built on Prince Edward Island  in 1853  was  copper  and iron fastened, sheated in yellow metal and with 10 pairs of iron hanging knees, it is possible that  Mr Gorman had seen part of the Occator , though equally they may be  from another vessel. See the list of other as yet unfound wrecks following.

THE VESSEL
The barque Ocean Queen was built at Whitby by J. Langborne and Company in 1831, and owned by Robert Brooks. On 10 July 1840 it had been badly damaged when it struck at Flinders Island Bass Strait, while on a voyage from London to Launceston in Tasmania. The vessel was subsequently repaired. The Ocean Queen was bound from Launceston to Bali in ballast and had aboard a chest of specie.
THE LOSS
The Ocean Queen under the command of Captain Harrington, with fourteen crew, struck Half Moon Reef while sailing at 6 knots early in the morning of 13 September 1842. The vessel was thrown on its ‘beam ends’ and bilged. The crew used the ship’s boats to get ashore on an island (described as a large island) where they stayed for two days. Captain Harrington initially claimed that he had buried the specie on the island during this time. The men then embarked in the Ocean Queen’s boats in an attempt to row to Fremantle. The wind and current were against them, and when about 125 km north of Fremantle, between Wedge Island and present day Lancelin, they abandoned the boats and walked the remaining distance, arriving in Fremantle on 9 October. An exhausted crewman, who had been left behind at the Moore River, arrived in Fremantle on 11 October, having been rescued by a party led by Mr von Bibra and James Milne.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The wreck of the Ocean Queen was sold for £25 (or possibly guineas) to Captain Daniel Scott, the Harbour-Master at Fremantle, in October 1842. He commenced salvage almost immediately by sending his boat, crewed by the mate and crew of the Ocean Queen, to the wreck. En route this boat stopped at the site where the survivors had come ashore, retrieved the abandoned boats from the Ocean Queen and the personal effects left buried by the sailors. They searched diligently but apparently unsuccessfully for the specie, which Captain Harrington now claimed to have buried there. A little over a week later Scott and Harrington left in the chartered cutter Venus for the wreck to supervise salvage efforts. On arrival Scott found that his boat, which had sailed from Fremantle over a week before the Venus, had arrived only two days before it.
He salvaged much of the moveable gear including the mail, stores, anchors, cables and part of the rigging from the barque, as well as the boats that had been abandoned on the coast.
The Perth Gazette and the Inquirer both queried how the wrecking had occurred, as Wickham and Stokes on board HMS Beagle had recently accurately surveyed the Houtman Abrolhos. Further, the wrecking took place not during a storm but in favourable winds. Captain Scott besides being harbour-master was also Lloyd’s agent, and it was in this latter position that he had sold the wreck to himself. At the time there was some public disquiet and scepticism over this sale and the failure to recover the specie.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Ocean Queen lies on Half Moon Reef between the Zeewijk and Windsor wreck sites.
SITE DESCRIPTION
A trail of ballast stones lies from about 20 m inshore of the wave line across the reef top to the lagoon.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
A museum inspection team in 1979 recovered a cannon ball, copper sheathing tacks, spikes, a copper ring bolt and some glass and pottery sherds. The small artefacts were recovered from crevices and holes in the reef, and the cannon ball from the reef top.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
There remain unanswered questions regarding the fate of the specie carried on board the Ocean Queen. Note however that ‘specie’ is a very vague term and it may be that it was not of great value.
Some criticism has been made of the fact that Captain Scott in his capacity as Lloyd’s agent sold the wreck to himself as a private citizen. It cannot be denied that he was an interested party, however Western Australia had such a small population at that time that many people held multiple positions. Money in the colony was in such short supply that even the £25 paid for the wreck, combined with its isolation on the Houtman Abrolhos, would not have been an attractive proposition for many businessmen.

Rixen and Company","Captain James Joass","Leaked and sank","N","8.30","","Guano","Aus 333 & BA 1033"," Oleander was built under Special Survey by Haswell in 1861 at Sunderland, England. It was copper fastened and sheathed with yellow metal over felt. It had a raised quarterdeck 8.2?m long. The owners were Alfred Rixon & Co. of London.
The barque had loaded 80 tonnes of guano at Shark Bay in late 1883. While there it had grounded for about five hours but without causing any apparent damage. It then left for Barrow Island but, as there was no cargo available there, returned to Shark Bay for further guano. Twice again the vessel touched bottom, but again there appeared to be no reason for concern. However as a precaution the master, Captain James Joass, limited his cargo to 400 tons rather than the Oleander’s 550 tons maximum capacity. The vessel left Shark Bay on 23 February 1884. The ship was to call at Champion Bay for provisions before sailing for Hamburg.
THE LOSS
On 25 February 1884 the Oleander was about 80 km west of the Abrolhos Islands when heavy weather blew up. The heavy seas caused the vessel to ‘work’ and leak badly, so all hands were required at the pumps. When the gales abated the leak became less severe, although hourly pumping was still needed. Captain Joass decided it was safe to head directly for Fremantle in order for repairs to be made. On 1 March when the vessel was about 48 km north-west of Wedge Island the leak worsened. Despite all hands at the pumps again, the water continued to rise in the hold.
About 9.00 a.m. Captain Joass decided to make for the shore under shortened sail. The crew prepared the ship’s boats with provisions and readied them for abandoning ship. By noon there was 2.5 m of water in the hold and the cargo of guano was washing about. Captain Joass realized that he could not save the vessel and ordered the crew to abandon ship. They stayed near the Oleander for about an hour, with a crewman going aboard to sound the pumps. As the water was found to be still rising, they left the vessel and the boats made for the shore, which could now be seen.
INQUIRY
An inquiry was held at Fremantle on 6 March 1884. Captain Joass was found to be free from blame; the members of the inquiry did however feel that he was imprudent not to have returned to Shark Bay when the leak occurred. Captain Joass praised the behaviour of his crew during the crisis.","NO","UK","","","","5.20","N","118/80","N","N","","","35.70","","","","","43921","Sunderland","Shark Bay","London","Hamburg","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

Leslie and Co","Howard Smith & Sons, Melbourne","Calder","Parted cables, driven ashore","Y","9.30","","Coal","AUS 117","The 605-ton barque-rigged iron screw steamer was built at Newcastle, England in 1858. Part of its cargo on its maiden voyage to Australia were the materials and equipment for laying the Bass Strait submarine cable. After many years carrying passengers and cargo between Melbourne and Adelaide and then  New Zealand Omeo was sent to Port Darwin in 1870 on charter to the  contractors  completing the northern section of the Overland Telegraph line linking Australia to Britain via Singapore.  She then played a major part in the construction of the overland telegraph line from Darwin, carrying telegraph poles and cargo 160 km up the Roper River. After making over 100 round trips to New Zealand her engines were removed in 1880 and her funnel replaced with a new mast. As a 4-masted ‘jackass barque’ ( Two square and two barque rigged masts). In that distinctive livery Omeo voyaged between Melbourne and Newcastle and  it traded for many years in the Pacific and Indian Oceans carrying passengers and cargo.  During its long life Omeo suffered a number of collisions, including one   in which it demolished with the  Swanspit Lighthouse in Port Phillip Bay, luckily with no loss of life and another  after a voyage from Japan when it was run into by a steamer while at anchor in at Sydney  Harbour and nearly sunk. In September  1895 she arrived at Hamelin Bay with cargo , passengers and  stock and  in the following month ran aground after destroying part of the jetty there  while  loaded with 500 tons of jarrah timber. After being refloated  it was sent to Fremantle for use as a hulk (a redundant ship used as a floating warehouse, often carrying coal for steamers). There it was used to service steamers from the Blue Star line
 After a decade in that service, it became redundant and was left on a mooring possibly in  Owen Anchorage, the old port for Fremantle. The West Australian  newspaper recorded that, on  the afternoon of  September 12  1905, … Omeo which was abandoned about half a mile from the shore parted her moorings and drifted  onto the beach between Robbs Jetty and Woodmans Point’. Sand built up around the hull making it uneconomic to refloat the ship and for many years it was a popular  fishing and picnic spot for families who would walk across the sand to the site.  The area slowly became industrialised and as abattoirs and tanneries  began to dot the  adjacent coastline  a rock groyne was constructed  along the coast and just inshore  of the wreck causing the sand to reduce and the sea to cut the wreck off from the coast.  One abattoir had its outlet pipe in the remains.  Though the Department of the  Post Master General had interest in recovering the ship, given its role in the  development of Australia’s communication network, the idea was abandoned. In 1993 two of the ships anchors were found c. 45 metres west of the wreck and subsequently raised. Apparently thrown overboard as the wreck difted ashore, their stocks had not been set and they proved useless in the strong winds
The wreck of Omeo is located approximately 40m off Coogee Beach, mostly submerged in approximately 2-4m of water. The sternpost and a section of the collapsed bow triangle are the only features that permanently protrude from the water. The shipwreck site encompasses an area of approximately 75m x 15m, was  mapped by Maritime Archaeology Association of WA  between 1990 and 1992, and has since been the subject of a conservation assessment (MAAWA, 1992).
Omeo is the premier shore-based shipwreck dive in the Perth Metropolitan area and plans are underway to create a snorkelling and dive trail accompanied by a land-based maritime heritage trail incorporating Omeo’s anchors.","NO","UK","","2000/02/18","","5.10","120 HP auxiliary (removed)","2009/0171/SG _MA-19/80","Y","Y","-32.1055666667","","64.90","","115.7615333333","","","40338","Newcastle-on-Tyne","At anchor, Cockburn Sound","Melbourne","At anchor, Cockburn Sound","DGPS WGS84 (28/04/99)","Protected Federal","Dickson, Gregory, Australian Steamships Past and Present (photo)

In 1862 P&O sent out four iron lighters in sections to be constructed at Albany, which were to be used in conjunction with the hulk Kingfisher to supply their steamships with coal. Due to the shallow shores of Princess Royal Harbour rendering a slipway impracticable, it was decided to construct a floating dry dock for repairing and cleaning the lighters. The floating dry dock was built of jarrah with dimensions of 129 x 30 x 25 feet (39.3 x 9.1 x 7.6 metres) and launched in April 1866. It was a technological and shipbuilding first for Western Australia, was the largest vessel to be constructed in Albany, and one of only a small number of purpose-built floating docks in Australia.
After P&O ceased operations in Albany, local firm Armstrong and Waters took over the dock. The watertight doors never sealed perfectly necessitating a windmill pump in permanent operation. It appears to have sunk at its moorings in Princess Royal Harbour sometime during World War I and was partly salvaged, but as yet the site has not been relocated. It is believed to lie under reclaimed land on the Albany foreshore.
Any remains of the floating dock would be of technical, archaeological and historical significance as a unique, locally built vessel associated with the development of Albany and the P&O Company coaling trade.","NO","Australia","","","","7.60","","","N","N","","","39.30","","","","","","Albany","","","","","Protected State","Douglas at al, Marshall, G., 2001, Maritime Albany remembered, Tangee Pty Ltd, Kalamunda: 53-58.","Abandoned","401.00","","1866","1092","Wooden","Services","port services","Shipwreck","S Coast (Albany)"

MOTHER SHIP LOST
FOUNDERS OFF BROOME
Broome, July 17, 1939
The Japanese pearling fleet's mothership, Palao Maru, has sunk ten miles
off the coast with a full cargo, comprising the entire catch of the Japanese fleet. After bringing supplies to the fleet the Palao Mara loaded the fleet's first consignment of pearl shell from these waters, and on Saturday
night the crew noticed she was sinking. There was no time for salvage,
and the crew left the ship as it foundered. The loss is estimated at £10,000. (GGE 18/7/1939 p.1)
Ship with 10,000 pounds cargo sinks
Broome, Monday
The Palao Maru, mother ship of a Japanese fleet operating south of Broome, foundered quickly on Saturday night, taking to the bottom 90 tons of shell and allowing the crew just time to scramble off. Her crew had noticed that she was bumping strangely and sluggishly through smooth-rolling seas. Then the cry was flung from mouth to mouth that the ship was sinking. Dinghies splashed into the water and the 14 men pulled desperately clear as the Palao Maru plunged through 12 fathoms. The vessel is about 10 miles from the shore and a total loss on her pearlshell is inevitable. Of 150 tons, the ship carried valuable equipment. Pearlshell is worth £100 a ton, and the total loss will probably reach £10,000.The disaster is thought to have
been caused by a leakage in the seawater well in the hold. This is a special contraption that allows water to flow through to preserve live oyster shells used for culture. Representatives are endeavouring to obtain the use of a salvage vessel as soon as possible in the hope of recovering the Palao Maru.

"Pannet's Lighter","unknown","King George Sound, King Point","","","","","N","","","","","One of the four large lighters prefabricated from 6 mm iron plates in England and shipped, along with the necessary tools to assemble them, on the P&O sailing ship Haddington (1 459 tons, Captain Browne). It arrived at Albany from Southampton on 4 December 1862. During 1863-64 the lighters were assembled under the supervision of Captain Charles Loius van Zuilecom on a flat rock near the company’s jetty. Although described by the company as barges, they appear to in fact have been yawls, possibly capable of long sea voyages. On 4 May 1863 a Perth newspaper’s Albany correspondent reported:
The first of the P&O Company’s new lighters under construction has been launched and named Albany. I learn that the second is to be called Fremantle. Though these vessels are reckoned barges by the Company, they are really fine coasters of 140 tons each, length 76 feet, beam 18 feet, hold 10 feet, and masts of 45 and 20 feet, yawl rigged, and it was originally intended to sail them out from England (Inquirer, 13 May 1863: 2f).
This lighter, like that sunk in Frenchman Bay (see entry), most probably had a counter stern.
The second lighter was launched on 29 August 1863 by ‘Miss Symers’ (most probably one of the daughters of Captain Thomas Symers of Albany) and named Fremantle. The last was launched in April 1864.
The lighters were used by P&O to carry water, coal and stores out to ships anchored in Princess Royal Harbour. There is some evidence that at least in later years they were towed to the waiting vessels by tugs or launches. In his reminiscences Captain Ernie Donohue states that one of his jobs was towing three lighters ‘of 130 tons each from Frenchman’s Bay outside Albany to the Town jetty full of water for shipping callers’ (Marshall, 2001: 277). The lighters were divided by bulkheads into five or six separate holds, and were capable of carrying 500 tons of water. After the withdrawal of P&O from Albany, the lighters were used by the Douglas family and the Armstrong and Waters Lighterage Company.
 Nobbie Pannet  purchased another lighter which was sunk by explosives near Whale Rock, between that rock and Middleton Beach. According to reports, the bottom of the hull proved to be sound, and the explosives failed to make holes in it.
Another of the lighters was abandoned, probably about 1890, near the water supply at Whalers Beach in Frenchman Bay (see entry). The wreck of a third iron lighter is shown on two sketch maps, one by Howard Hartman and the other by Les Douglas, published in Marshall, 2001. Another wreck is shown just to the east of the base of the P&O coaling jetty.","NO","","","","","","","","N","N","","","","","","","","","","","","","Position from Shipwrecks Chart Albany","Unknown","","Scuttled","","","","960","Iron","Services","port services","Shipwreck","S Coast (Albany)"

Rivers","","Y","7.35","","Stores and buoying materials","1059;AUS 119, BA 3189 & BA 3221","Penguin was a ketch-rigged steamer built by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Co. Ltd for the Government of Western Australian. Launched in March 1897, it had one deck and five bulkheads, and had been cemented. The engine, a triple expansion compound steam engine, had been built by the ship builder, and the vessel was fitted with electric lights. It had a fore peak water ballast tank which held 45 tons. The steamer was used for survey work, rescue and salvage operations.
During World War I the Penguin had been used as a coastal patrol vessel under the name of HMAS Gannet, reverting to its previous name after the war. In 1920 it was carrying out a fishing survey of the Esperance archipelago and the Great Australian Bight. Penguin had undergone a refit during which it was fitted with ‘an insulated fish room, in which the fish will be stored in ice and periodically conveyed to Albany for disposal’ (West Australian, 7 June 1920: 5a). The fish caught were to be sold in Albany and other country towns, or taken to Perth if the catch proved too big for local sales. It was under the command of Captain T.S. Talbot with a crew of fifteen, and also on board was Captain Feltham, an experienced North Sea trawling master. The Penguin departed Fremantle on 5 June 1920 for Albany, arriving in the early evening of 13 June. The vessel then left on an exploratory survey of the seas off the south coast. The vessel was insured for £6 000.
THE LOSS
A gale struck the Penguin when it was some 90 miles offshore. As no headway could be made in the rough seas Captain Talbot took the steamer in towards the mainland and dropped anchor. The wind was, however, found to be still too strong and he decided to seek shelter in Goose Island Bay on Middle Island, some 15 miles away. Here the ship anchored with 30 fathoms (55 m) of chain out only 1½ cables (274 m) from the shore.  The heavy rain and gale force winds continued, with a steadily falling barometer. About 4.30 p.m. on 27 June the wind changed direction and the Penguin, with a full load of fish (including two tons of snapper) on board, was blown onto a reef. One of the members of the crew related what happened next:
The one serviceable boat was launched, and two members of the crew got in and attempted to reach the shore, about 50 yards off, but they had to swim half-way owing to her capsizing. The boat was on a line from the ship, and was pulled back, and some of the men got ashore in her. Some clothing was then sent off, but the first load was capsized. The mate came ashore with only his pyjama suit and his dog, and other men lost portion of their gear. At about 10 o’clock at night it got too rough for any more men or food to come off to the shore, and those who remained on the ship (about six) stayed there for the night in the driest places they could find. The ship’s stern was below water and her bows were up. The men on shore spent the night in a blizzard, unprotected except for wet blankets. About 6 o’clock next morning we got a few more things off, and more of the crew came ashore (West Australian, 17 July 1920: 6f).
The crew made a camp from a sail and set a watch on the hill to look out for any passing vessels. The steamer Eucla was en route from Eucla to Albany when at 11.30 p.m. on 1 July a fire was noted on Middle Island. This was a flare the crew had set using some kerosene salvaged from the wreck. The Eucla anchored, and sent a boat ashore to investigate. The Eucla stood by all night, and the following morning an inspection of the Penguin showed it to be lying with its bow on the edge of a reef off the beach at the Goose Island Bay anchorage, with the stern badly holed and sunk. It was obvious that nothing could be done to salvage the Penguin, so (with the exception of the mate, a fireman and a seaman left to guard the wreck) the crew and their personal belongings were taken on board the Eucla which sailed for Albany, arriving later that day.
INQUIRY
A Court of Inquiry into the loss of the Penguin was held in Perth. On 19 July 1920 Captain Winsar, the chief harbour-master, stated:
In my opinion no blame is attachable to the engine-room staff, but the master – Captain T.S. Talbot – committed an error of judgement in anchoring so close to the shore, and not giving more consideration to the weather conditions and falling barometer. I recommend however, that no further action be taken under the Navigation Act 1904 (West Australian, 19 August 1920: 7b).
INITIAL SALVAGE
The Government claimed from the underwriters and were paid the £6 000 sum insured for the loss of the Penguin. The State then purchased the wreck for £1 000 and sent a salvage crew, including divers, on the State owned steamer Eucla to the wreck. The Eucla made a number of voyages to the site to collect salvaged material, including the trawling gear which was retained by the Fisheries Department for possible future use. The other salvaged gear was expected to sell for £2 000.
Further work on the wreck was considered to be unprofitable and the Government called for tenders to purchase the wreck of the Penguin. The highest tender of £50 was not accepted, and the wreck was put up for auction. This was even worse as the highest bid was only £1, so private negotiations were commenced.
The partnership of S. Richards and J. Mackenzie paid the government £20 for the salvage rights to the wrecked Penguin. Commencing in October 1921, they were left on Middle Island with supplies sufficient for six weeks. However, it was some twelve weeks before they were finally picked up, having lived on sea birds, wallabies and fish after their food ran out. In January 1922 their work was completed, and the salvaged material removed from Middle Island. What then remained at the site was part of the hull and some engine machinery.

Thompson & Co. Ltd’s Aberdeen White Star Line. Launched on 21 December 1907, it had a straight stem, two decks, an awning deck, eight bulkheads and steel wales sheathed with wood. The twin-screw steamer had one funnel, four pole masts, a bridge deck 47.6 m long, a forecastle 19.5 m long, and six cargo hatches. Steam for the two quadruple expansion engines was produced in three double-ended and two single-ended boilers, giving it a speed of 14–15 knots. The ship was fitted with a cellular double bottom extending the full length of the hull, had eight watertight compartments and bilge keels. The accommodation was lavish and extremely comfortable. A newspaper reported:
No less than four decks are utilised for the accommodation of saloon passengers, although only 100 are carried. The dining saloon, which is on the main deck, is a broad spacious apartment extending the full width of the ship. Large portholes are fitted for light and ventilation, while an auxiliary arrangement of fans is also provided in order to ensure comfort and fresh air in all weather.
The predominant colour of the carpet and upholstery is crimson, and the floor polished oak parquetry. The walls are of carved white panelling, relieved with gold, and with a dado of oak, and the ceiling is white. The saloon, library and lounge are situated at the forward end of the bridge deck, and are divided by a handsome glass screen, each room having a separate entrance.
The staterooms in the deckhouse on the bridge deck…are particularly light and airy, being nearly 10 ft in height…(Sydney Morning Herald, 24 August 1908, quoted in Plowman, 2009: 96).
Under the command of Captain Alexander Simpson, commodore of the shipping line, the Pericles was en route to London via Fremantle and the Cape of Good Hope with a large mixed cargo of 32 000 boxes of butter, 35 000 frozen mutton carcases, 6 000 bales of wool, hides, 3?000 cases of apples (picked up in Hobart) of which 500 cases were carried on deck, 25 tons of tallow, coconut oil and 600 tons of lead and sundry other items. The lead had a high gold and platinum content, and was being shipped to Europe. At that time there was no place in Australia where these precious metals could be extracted from the lead. There were 298 passengers bound for South Africa and England, and a crew of 163. The ship had been to Brisbane, Sydney, Hobart then Melbourne, taking on board cargo and passengers from each port. The Pericles was deeply laden and had a draught of 8.53 m forward and 8.23 m aft. The vessel and cargo was insured for £750 000, of which one-third was vessel and two-thirds cargo (£90 000 of this was for the butter alone). The departure of the Pericles from Melbourne had been delayed for three days by a coal strike, and the ship sailed on 24 March 1910 on its voyage to Fremantle. Captain Simpson had made about 80 trips to Australia in his forty-six years at sea.
THE LOSS
Just after noon on 31 March 1910, five days after leaving Melbourne, the Pericles passed White Topped Rocks, with the coast about five miles to starboard. At 3.32 p.m., in clear weather and with good visibility, the steamer travelling at 14 knots struck an uncharted rock near St Alouarn Islet, 6.5 km south-east of Cape Leeuwin. It passed over the rock, but the damage to the forward plates was so great that within three minutes there were 5 m of water in the forward hold. The chief engineer, W.L. Robertson, and his crew worked waist deep in water attempting to shore up bulkheads and keep the pumps going.
The steamer Strathfillan was steaming southwards to the west of the Pericles at the time but, despite turning his vessel broadside on to the Strathfillan and blowing the whistle and flying distress signals, Captain Simpson could not attract its attention. He therefore ordered the passengers and crew to abandon ship, which was carried out in an orderly manner within 25 minutes.
Passengers were helped into lifejackets and then into fourteen lifeboats, which were rowed towards the shore where fires had been lit by the Cape Leeuwin lighthouse staff to guide them to the best landing place in Sarge Bay. An officer could not be put in command of each boat, as that would have left none to look after the launching of later boats. Several of the officers who had stayed behind and only boarded the last boat therefore jumped overboard and swam to those boats which were without a responsible person in charge. All passengers and crew were saved, but the one-eyed ship’s cat, Nelson, was drowned. The ship drifted with the swell and south-east wind for a short while before going down by the bow, canting to starboard at the same time. All the boats landed during daylight except the last, that containing the captain, who had stayed behind close to his ship until it had sunk. This boat did not reach shore until 7.00 p.m.
The steamship Monaro took most of the passengers to Fremantle the day after the wrecking, embarking them from the Flinders Bay Jetty during rough weather in what was described as a fine example of seamanship. Some thirty or so passengers elected to make their way overland to Fremantle.
INQUIRY
A Preliminary Inquiry into the loss of the Pericles was held by the Fremantle Harbour Master, Captain Irvine, on 5 April 1910. He recommended to the Colonial Secretary that a Court of Inquiry should be held. This inquiry was held at the Fremantle Courthouse on 7 April 1910 before E.P. Dowley, Resident Magistrate, W.G. Walter, Resident Magistrate and two nautical assessors, Captain Robert Laurie and Captain F.L. Parkes. It was pointed out that in charting the area around Cape Leeuwin the soundings had been made at one mile intervals, and it was therefore possible to miss an object like a pinnacle of rock such as that on which the Pericles had come to grief.
For the information of the Court of Inquiry, and because of the danger to shipping of an uncharted rock, the court was adjourned while the government steamer Penguin under the command of Captain James Airey was sent to the area to locate both the wreck and the rock on which the Pericles had struck. By sweeping with a long line Captain Airey located the wreck and advised the authorities by telegram:
Exact position of Pericles is south 3 deg. west (magnetic) from the Leeuwin Lighthouse, a distance of two miles seven chains. The depth of water is 16 fathoms alongside, and there is three fathoms of water on the derricks and spars, increasing to twelve fathoms on the portion of the wreck of the vessel which is lying about east (quoted in Millar, 1978: 105).
On 14 April the Court of Inquiry concluded that:
Proper care and vigilance were exercised in the navigation of the vessel by the master and officers, and proper steps were taken to fix her position, and from time to time to verify such position.
The vessel was kept on the course stated in the evidence given by the Master.
Such course, as set and steered, was one which, in all the circumstances of the occasion, the Master was justified in considering a safe and proper one.
While on such course as stated in the evidence, the vessel struck a submerged obstruction which is uncharted and thereby foundered (quoted in Fyfe, 1999: 16).
The wreck was a hazard to shipping as the derricks and spars were not far below sea level. This prompted a Notice To Mariners signed by the Chief Harbour Master, C.J. Irvine, in the Government Gazette of 22 April 1910 stating the position of the uncharted rock to be approximately:
Lighthouse bearing north 2 deg. west (magnetic), distant 7 miles. Latitude 34 deg. 28 min. 50 sec. south, longitude 115 deg. 9 min. 5 sec. East. Depth of water over rock about 24 feet.
The wreck itself lay in:
16 fathoms (96 feet) of water, with from two to three fathoms over her spars. The Lighthouse bearing north 3 deg. west (magnetic), distant 2 miles and 7 cables. Latitude 34 deg. 24 min. 35 sec. south, longitude 115 deg. 8 min. 10 sec. east.
However the search for the rock was unsuccessful, so the Penguin was recalled on 4 May 1910. In mid-May it was noted that one of the masts or a derrick was standing up out of the water some 2 m, and three days later was projecting 3 m above the sea. It was surmised at the time that the ship, which had sunk canted to starboard, had gradually rolled to a more upright position.
In December 1910 HMS Fantome was also sent to locate the rock, but after four days without any success it was concluded that the Pericles, in hitting the pinnacle, had probably knocked it over or at least knocked part of it off.
INITIAL SALVAGE
A great deal of the lighter cargo of the Pericles was washed ashore over subsequent weeks. Local residents collected boxes of butter and apples, barrels of coconut oil, empty barrels, doors and other timber, while the steamer Una salvaged 1 800 boxes of butter and some tallow, most of it in good condition. Three syndicates of local men with bullock teams were formed to collect any cargo washed up, and ‘it is recorded locally that each syndicate made £1 000’ (Cresswell, 2003: 116).
It was reported that in 1919 a firm named Ball and Sons searched, supposedly without success, to find the wreck site. This would seem to be J.E. ‘Jimmy’ Ball and his two sons who, according to an article in the Sunday Times published fifty years later on 12 January 1969, found the wreck and salvaged fittings from it. The informant for that article, Bill Riley, operated the air pumps aboard the Florrie (described as a flat-bottomed steamboat) from which the Balls were diving.
One of the lifeboats was acquired by a fisherman, Bob Smith of Busselton, who had it converted to cutter rig, named it Rose, and used it for fishing for many years. It was washed ashore, with Smith still on board, during the cyclone which struck Geographe Bay in 1937 (see entry). Another was purchased by a Bunbury man, John Forster, so that his family and friends could go fishing and crabbing. A third lifeboat was bought by Lionel Pearce, equipped with a mast and sail and also used as a fishing boat. This boat was still sailing as late as 1957.

The site is located 5.6 km south of the Cape Leeuwin lighthouse at a depth of about 35 m.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck site is approximately 180 m long and 70 m wide, with the prominent features being three large boilers and the port engine standing upright. There is also the starboard engine (which is lying on its side), the two propeller shafts, propellers, anchors and copper pipes together with part of the vessel’s framing. Some ingots of lead are scattered near the propeller shafts in the stern area of the wreck.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
In January 1957 Tom Snider, an American submariner who had been put ashore at Fremantle due to illness, again located the wreck and formed the Universal Salvage Company. He did salvage work on the wreck from 1957 until 1961, with particular emphasis on recovering the lead with its high silver and platinum content. The company recovered some 400–500 tons of ingots, the first shipment of 100 tons leaving Bunbury for London in early March 1957, and Snider presented the harbour-master at Fremantle, Captain F.H.B. Humble, with two bronze valves from the wreck. In 1961 Tom Snider was killed in an air crash in the north-west of Western Australia, but his widow continued salvage work until a little later she sold the salvage rights to Tom Pike of Augusta, who had worked as a diver for the Universal Salvage Company. In 1989 Pike advised the Western Australian Museum of the location of the wreck. By that time the owner of the wreck of the Pericles was Frank Lehane, and his widow subsequently gifted the wreck to the Western Australian Museum.
The Pericles had two propellers, plus a third chained to the deck as a spare. At least three propeller blades each weighing two tons were salvaged and sold to a scrap metal merchant in Fremantle.
A bell from the Pericles is on display at the Augusta Historical Museum. An Aberdeen White Star Line house flag, removed at the time of the wrecking by one of the ship’s engineers, John Winning Watson, was presented to the Western Australian Museum by Dr Richard Watson, nephew of the engineer.
Peter Buzzacott of the Pericles Research Group has done a lot of work over recent years mapping and photographing the site. As the wreck of the Pericles is now protected by law, further disturbance of the site is not permitted.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
TECHNICAL (2)
The Pericles is the only vessel wrecked on the Western Australian coast to have been powered by a quadruple expansion compound engine. This makes the wreck technically important for the study of large early 20th century steam engines and their associated equipment.
SOCIAL (3)
The three Leeuwin lighthouse keepers, Joseph Lyons, David Miner and Ernest McDonald were given awards by the Royal Humane Society in recognition of their efforts during the rescue. The Reverend W. Scott Clarke was given a gold watch and his daughter, Miss A. Scott Clarke, a gold brooch for their efforts in caring for the survivors when they first came ashore.
As the Monaro had very limited accommodation, the officers gave up their quarters so that the female survivors could be made comfortable. A verse was subsequently written:
All honour to the Monaro, her captain and her crew;
They had to do the hard work, and well they did it too.
The liner she’s a lady, her course is cut and dried:
Our liner’s down below the sea, from the Leeuwin four miles wide (quoted in Gregory, 1928: 202).
In 1900 the assistant surveyor on HMS Penguin (a different vessel from the Western Australian Government steamer Penguin sent from Fremantle after the accident) was Lieutenant Charles Richard Wynn Brewis. He was on board that vessel when it was used to survey the waters off Cape Leeuwin. During his seven year tour of duty in Australian waters he married a girl from Hobart, Corry Jeanette Crosby, daughter of William Crosby, M.L.C. Brewis and his family returned to England in 1903. In 1910 Mrs Brewis and their three children visited her parents in Hobart. Their return passage to England was on board the Pericles, which struck an uncharted rock in the area which had been surveyed by her husband some ten years earlier.
Tom Snider was searching for other wrecks to salvage when in 1961 he was killed in a plane crash. He had obtained the salvage rights to a number of wrecks including the Orizaba and the Michael J Galoundris. He located the wreck of the Pericles by being towed at a depth of about 20 m suspended on the anchor line of a small boat.
RARE (7)
The Pericles is the largest vessel to be wrecked in the area and time span covered by this book.
Officer requested to accompany the survivors on the Monaro to give assistance if required. “I beg to state that I gave the stewards every assistance on the journey between Flinders Bay and Fremantle by keeping some of the roughest of the 3rd class passengers from the saloon to which they crowded for the purpose of obtaining Drink which the Captain prohibited and also some of them from the lady’s sleeping compartments”.
12 life boats landed crew and passengers near Leeuwin lighthouse. No lives lost.

A storm struck the south-west of Western Australia on 28 February 1845. The Perseverance parted its anchor cable and was driven ashore, becoming a complete wreck.

Moore","Captain Peter Littlejohn","Hit whale, holed","N","5.90","","Timber","1034","  Pet, a single-decked 2-masted topsail schooner with an oval counter stern and a good sheer, was built by Robert Wrightson at Fremantle, and launched in February 1877. It had a small deckhouse at the break of the poop and a short forecastle deck. Wrightson’s yard, where he commenced operations in 1867, was on the beach between South Jetty and the mouth of the tunnel under the Roundhouse, and not far from the Commissariat building (Dickson, 1998). He initially maintained ownership of the schooner, but in June 1878 he sold 32 shares each to Alexander Joseph McRae and William Dalgety Moore. The vessel was under charter to Maurice Coleman Davies, who had a timber lease near Collie and had built two small mills at Worsley, transporting the timber to Bunbury by bullock cart. The Pet was deeply laden with a cargo of 120 tonnes of green tuart timber when it sailed at 6.30 a.m. on Wednesday 1 March 1882, under the command of Peter Littlejohn, with a crew of six. In his evidence to the subsequent inquiry the mate, William Henrietta, stated that ‘the vessel was very deep, I consider deeper laden than I like to see. She showed nineteen or twenty inches from her covering board to the water’ (quoted in Dixon, 2009a). The Pet was insured for £1 200.
THE LOSS
During the afternoon of Saturday 4 March 1882 a large sperm whale was seen, and within minutes it attacked the Pet, stoving in a large section of the starboard bow. The vessel began to sink and the crew, except the master, mate and one crewman, took to the boats. Captain Littlejohn is variously described as either being stunned by the incident and unable to comprehend his predicament (Cairns & Henderson, 1995), or that he went below to retrieve his navigation instruments and ship’s papers (Dickson, 1998). The contemporary newspaper reports and evidence given at the subsequent inquiry indicate that the captain was on deck at the time the Pet sank. Certainly he went down with the schooner, while the mate and the crewman only escaped a similar fate by diving off the stern at the last minute. The vessel sank only three minutes after being struck. After waiting unsuccessfully to see if Captain Littlejohn’s body would come to the surface, the mate and the crew made for Hamelin Bay which they reached about 2.30 p.m. the following day, having rowed for 22 hours.
A report by the crew states:
When about 50 miles to the south-west of Cape Leeuwin a large sperm whale was sighted in the distance off the starboard quarter. At first the monster did not attract a great amount of attention, but something must have occurred to enrage the beast as it suddenly charged the ship in the most determined manner. So suddenly was the onslaught made that there was no time to take steps to evade or repel the attack. The whale struck on the starboard bow, knocking a large hole in her through which the water poured with great rapidity. Captain Littlejohn was drowned and the crew, W. Henrietta, mate; W. Bull, G. Moore, H. Green, W. Waldon and B. Nelson made it to safety (quoted in Dickson, 1996).
INQUIRY
The subsequent Court of Inquiry held at Busselton before Joseph Strelley Harris, acting subcollector of Customs, and Dr Charles Smith Bompass, J.P., on 13 March 1882 attached no blame for the loss on the captain, finding that the Pet had been rammed and sunk by a large sperm whale. It was noted that Captain Littlejohn had not attempted to save himself. The mate stated in his evidence that he was below decks when at about 4.25 p.m. he heard the man at the wheel cry out that there was a whale close to the Pet:
I ran on deck and saw the wake of the whale about ten fathoms on our starboard bow. I intended to go forward and before I reached the end of the poop, he struck us. I knew by the crash of the timber some serious damage had occurred to the vessel.
I gave orders to sound the pumps, all the men were on deck with the exception of the captain. I saw the whale lying alongside the vessel apparently stunned, also pieces of planking belonging to the vessel floating about. I gave orders to cut the lashings of the boat. We had two boats on the main hatch. I went forward to inspect the damage and found the whole of the starboard bow from the cat-head to the starboard fore rigging was stove in and the water rushing in.
I immediately ran aft and said ‘never mind the pumps, we must get the boat over the side’. I assisted to get them over, while doing so the captain came out of his cabin, which was a house on deck and asked what all the noise was about. I replied, ‘we have been struck by a whale and are foundering.’ He disbelieved it so I requested him to look for himself. The bowsprit and windlass being under water at this time. We had been going at the rate of 6 knots.
The captain appeared stupefied. We launched the boat, all the crew were present helping, we put oars into the boat. I instructed the four men who were in her to get clear of the vessel. I threw several more oars overboard. About this time the water was a foot over the main hatch. One of the men called out I have got the rowlocks. I then jumped onto the poop. The captain had hold of a lifeline and was looking forward at the vessel going down.
I called to him. ‘You had better jump into the boat,’ but he made no answer whereupon I again asked him to jump. But he turned slowly round, and staring aft, said vaguely, ‘Bring the boat here.’ I then called to the cook to bring the boat alongside to enable the captain to get in, but the men in the boat said, ‘No, we shall be drawn down by the sinking vessel.’ I walked aft and got out on the stern.
Her rudder and about 8 or 10 feet of the keel was out of the water at this time, looking forward her fore topsail had taken aback as she was going down and broke off at the fore topmast—short of the cap. I dived right astern as far as I could from the vessel—Green also did the same. When I got to the surface the vessel had disappeared.
I did not see the Captain after speaking to him. We were out of sight of land and according to my reckoning about 50 miles SW of Cape Leeuwin. The vessel foundered about 4.30 p.m.. We remained at the spot for some time amongst the wreckage which continually came up, looking for the Captain. We took two sheep into the boat.
I was aware that the course to be steered was NE and I steered that course by the moon as nearly as I could. We sighted land at daylight, Cape Leeuwin and I think we were quite 20 miles away. I told the men I would make for Port Hamelin where we arrived about 2.30 p.m. on Sunday. There was a very nasty sea running all night and rain squalls from the SW, the wind favourable for us.
I should say the whale was 60 or 70 feet long, the largest whale I have seen of the sort, and we had seen no sign of whales before this one (quoted in Dickson, 2009).","NO","WA","","","1","2.50","N","","N","N","","","26.10","","","","","75293","Fremantle","Bunbury","Fremantle","Adelaide","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., (2012).

"Planet","1890/05/10","Port Irwin (Port Denison)","Robert  Howson","W. Lakey","Charles Morgan","Chain unshackled","N","5.00","","Grain, general","A 752","Year built:	1876 (Dickson, 1996), 1877 (Totty, 1979; Jackson, 1879)
  Date lost:	10 May 1890 (Totty, 1979; Cairns & Henderson, 1995) or 9 May 1890 (McKenna, 1959; Dickson, 1996)
Robert Howson built the Planet at Fremantle in 1876/77. McKenna states that the registered date of building is given as 1 February 1877. As this was the first vessel registered at Fremantle in 1877 it is obvious that it was built during 1876 and the very early part of 1877. A two-masted schooner, it had one deck and an oval counter stern. Howson was from Sunderland in England and was brought out to Fremantle by John Bateman to build vessels for his fleet. As far as can be ascertained the Planet was the first vessel Howson built after arriving in Fremantle aboard the Spinaway in December 1875.
The first owner was William John Cousins Lakey, master mariner and boat owner of Fremantle. The schooner was sold in February 1883 to a consortium consisting of Samuel Fortescue Moore, merchant of Dongara, Henry James Saw, merchant of Fremantle, Edward Clarkson, pearler of Cossack and William Dalgety Moore, merchant of Fremantle. The Planet was involved in several strandings during its working life. In July 1878 it dragged moorings off Fremantle and was blown onto South Beach. On 4 June 1880 it was driven ashore during a gale at Geraldton. On this occasion it was refloated with little damage. A third incident occurred when it struck a reef off Delambre Island in July 1881.
THE LOSS
The Planet had sailed from Geraldton on 8 May 1890 with a cargo of 235 bags of wheat (Totty, 1979) or 230 tonnes grain and 6 tonnes of general cargo (Cairns & Henderson, 1995) for Fremantle. The figure given by Totty would seem to be more correct as the vessel had a registered tonnage of less than 65 tons and was only 22.2 m in length. Arriving at Dongara on 9 May, Captain Henry Makaals at first anchored off but later picked up the government mooring. During the night the wind freshened and became a storm, the pin came out of the shackle on the mooring and the schooner was washed onto the rocks about 100 m north of the jetty at 3.10 a.m. There had been no time to drop the Planet’s anchor as the mooring was only 45 fathoms (80 m) from the shore. This wrecking therefore occurred during the early morning hours of 10 May 1890. The same storm caused the schooner Electra to be stranded at Dongara.
INQUIRY
An inquiry on 20 May 1890 exonerated master and crew, as it was found that the parting of a link in the government mooring chain was the cause of the wrecking. Evidence given at the inquiry was that the chain had not been examined for fourteen or fifteen months. Leonard Worsley Clifton, Collector of Customs, stated ‘I would observe that on a rocky bottom like that at Dongara the best chain would be liable to part if kinked around a rock so that the strain would not come fair and true’ (quoted in Totty, 1979: 33).
INITIAL SALVAGE
Only six packages of the cargo were saved. The crew were taken to Fremantle by the steamer Rob Roy. The vessel was not insured.","NO","WA","","","","2.40","N","115/80","N","N","","","22.20","","","","","75295","Fremantle","Cossack","Fremantle","Fremantle","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

Charles Watson built the Premier for himself at his yard in Perth. A wooden two-masted schooner, it was built of jarrah and had a square stern. Watson had done his apprenticeship under Thomas Mews. During his working life he built a number of pilot boats, gigs and dinghies for various government departments. Watson mortgaged the schooner in September 1869 to Henry Saw, storekeeper of Perth for £1?000 at 25%. This mortgage was discharged in August 1872. The Premier was sold to Mary Ann Saw, Thomas Saw and George Glyde a month later, and then sold by them to John Brockman, grazier of Busselton, a month after that. Brockman mortgaged the Premier to Thomas Ashford, innkeeper of Bunbury, for £450 at 10% within days of his purchase. In mid-April 1873 the vessel was lengthened and given a round stern. Less than three months later it was wrecked.
THE LOSS
The Premier arrived in Port Irwin on 28 June 1873 after a twelve-day voyage from Fremantle with a cargo of telegraph posts. The weather was too rough for it to be tied alongside the jetty. There were two anchors down when, on 1 July, a strong north-westerly wind caused it to drag the anchors. Despite letting go a third anchor the increasing wind drove it onto rocks near the shore in 2 m of water. The false keel and rudder were badly damaged. Reports describe the vessel’s bottom as being broken or holed. Strong north and north-westerly winds blew for the next three weeks. This anchorage is open to the north and north-west and the schooner would have pounded continuously on the rocks. The Premier was finally abandoned.
A letter from a Dongara correspondent to the editor of the Inquirer states:
I regret to report the stranding of the schooner Premier, which occurred on the 1st inst. The vessel was heavily laden with telegraph posts, and arrived in Port on the 11th ult. The weather was rough and the sea high so she was not hauled alongside the jetty to unload. There being no proper moorings the vessel dragged until she came onto a flat reef of rocks close to the shore. All her cargo has been recovered. Her bottom is broken, and she is in six or seven ft of water. With proper gear and good tackle the vessel might be hauled ashore and repaired, but there is not one article fit for the purpose at hand. The Irwin port is sure to get the blame of this accident. Fortunately it is the first wreck which has occurred through a vessel dragging her anchors. The loss could not have fallen upon a more worthy man than the owner (The Inquirer and Commercial News, 30 July 1873).
INQUIRY
An inquiry came to the conclusion that the poor holding ground offered by the flat rocky seabed caused the wrecking.
INITIAL SALVAGE
All the telegraph posts that made up the cargo were recovered. Julius Brockman, brother of the owner, later recovered an anchor chain, anchor and some tarpaulins.","NO","WA","","","","2.40","N","115/80","N","N","","","26.20","","","","","61092","Perth","Fremantle","Fremantle","Port Irwin","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

It was anticipated that the dredge Premier, which has been in the hands of shipbreakers at Fremantle since the end of last year, would be towed out to sea and sunk yesterday morning, but her end has been delayed, probably until next week. It had been intended to sink her in the Straggler Reef, between Rottnest Island and Carnac Island, but the Federal authorities have notified the agents of the owner that she will have to be sunk in the recognised ship graveyard outside Rottnest. A launch was to have towed her to the Straggler Reef, but a more powerful vessel will be required to tow her to the graveyard. This will probably be the steamer Emerald which is not available for the purpose this week. In view of the high price of steel and scrap iron, surprise has been expressed that the hull should be sunk. Inquiries have revealed that all the easily removable machinery, including much cast iron, brass and copper, has been removed by the shipbreakers, and it is practically only the shell of the vessel that remains. In view of her age, it was considered that, despite the high price obtainable for the metal, the amount of steel that would be gained by breaking up the hull would not return the amount of money spent on the work.
The West Australian 1938/03/30
A Dredge Goes to Her Grave.
Carrying a miscellaneous cargo, including broken up parts of motor vehicle bodies which, like herself, had reached the end of their useful life, the old dredge Premier was towed from North Wharf by the steamer Emerald early yesterday morning to the graveyard of ships, about eight miles south-east of Cape Vlaming, Rottnest Island, and sunk. As the dredge passed out of the harbour mouth to oblivion, … The dredge had been in the hands of ship breakers for several months and all her easily removable machinery, including much brass, cast Iron and copper had been removed, leaving almost only the shell of the vessel. Her end was delayed for some time. About three weeks ago it was intended to sink her in the Straggler Reef, between Rottnest Island and Carnac Island, but the Federal authorities insisted that she be sunk in the recognised ship graveyard. She was about 45 years old. She came to Australia under her own power as a new dredge in 1893 and was first employed in the construction of Fremantle Harbour. Later she was stationed at other West Australian ports, and in May, 1930, she was laid up at Fremantle.","Scuttled","69.00","","1893","1541","Iron","Services","port services","Shipwreck","Metro (Graveyard)"
"Preston","1861/07","Murray River","","William Owston","John Keefe","Ran ashore","N","4.40","","","","William Owston built the Preston at his yard at Preston Point on the Swan River for his own use. The vessel had one deck and a square stern. It was evidently a fast craft as the press reported that it sailed from Albany to Fremantle in only three days (Inquirer, 3 November 1858: 2f). Initially Owston used the schooner on the northern run, sailing between Fremantle and Port Gregory under the command of John Keefe. On 20 September 1855 the vessel stranded on Pelsaert Island in the Houtman Abrolhos, but it was got off in March the following year and continued trading along the coast. The Preston was stranded once again when, on 17 August 1859, it ‘was driven over the reef abreast of Nambung about 130 miles from Champion Bay, fortunately no lives were lost’ (Walter Gee to the Inspector of Police, quoted in de Burgh, 1986: 98). Again the vessel was quickly refloated.
THE LOSS
In June 1861, still under the command of John Keefe, the Preston was in danger of being overwhelmed in a gale and was deliberately run ashore on to a beach near the mouth of the Peel Inlet. The master stayed with the vessel for a while and then began to walk north towards Fremantle for help. He was later found dead on the road near Rockingham, having died of exposure. His date of death was given as 27 June 1861. Parsons (1971) quotes the registration papers as stating that the vessel sank in quicksand and defied every attempt to raise it, and was therefore abandoned.
INQUIRY
An inquest into the death of John Keefe was held by the Resident Magistrate, Fremantle, on 29 June 1861, but there appears to be no mention of an inquiry regarding the loss of the Preston.
INITIAL SALVAGE
From records it appears that although every effort was made to raise the Preston, it had sunk too far into the bottom mud and so the vessel was abandoned.
SITE LOCATION
In 1967 Jack Yates found the wreck of a wooden vessel about 14.6 m long approximately 550?m north-east of the mouth of the Peel Inlet. This was reported to the Western Australian Museum, but attempts since to locate the wreck have been unsuccessful. This wreck may be that of either the Preston, or possibly the Alert wrecked near the estuary inlet in 1875.
Another report to the Western Australian Museum (WAM File MA 206/80) states that an anchor 5–5½ ft (1.5–1.7 m) long, half upright and firmly concreted to the sea bed, covered in concretion and weed was found by some divers. Close by was the outline of boat about 50 ft (15.2 m) long, plus a straight artefact, most probably a mast. They also found some chain, links of which were brought up for analysis. This analysis showed that the chain was made from approximately three-quarter inch (19 mm) diameter wrought iron.","NO","WA","","","","1.70","N","206/80","N","N","","","13.90","","","","","40471","Preston Point","Fremantle","Fremantle","Port Gregory","","Protected Federal","IWorsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

There is no information on the Queen of Hearts other than that it was a gaff-rigged open boat and, at the time it was wrecked, was crewed by two men, Andrew Scott and William Roddick.
THE LOSS
The circumstances surrounding the loss of the Queen of Hearts are little known. It appears that the vessel left Fremantle on Monday 13 June 1887 on a fishing excursion (West Australian, 17 June 1887:3a). The quartermaster on board the Meda stated that he had seen the boat about 11.00 a.m. that morning, but on looking for it about half an hour later could not see any sight of men or boat.
When the pair had not returned the following day the Rescue was sent to search for them. The search area included both Garden and Carnac islands but proved unsuccessful. It was surmised that the boat had capsized and the two men drowned. In July 1887 a newspaper reported:
It is reported that Mr Arthur Clarke found on the beach, yesterday, about twenty miles to the northward of Bunbury, a boat’s mast, with sails attached. From the description given, it appears that the sail is one that is used with a gaff. To the mast is attached a piece of coir rope on which is a small iron grapnel, also a fishing line. It is surmised that the mast is probably that of the Queen of Hearts which the two men, Andrew Scott and his mate, Roderick [sic], left Fremantle some three weeks ago, and who, it is thought, were lost, as they have not been heard of since. No doubt the mast and sails, if the surmise is correct, can be identified (West Australian, 15 July 1887: 3a).
Nearly two months later another report stated:
A box containing candles, jams, etc. and a copy of the War Cry dated April 30th, 1887, was found on August 20th on the North Beach, about eighteen miles from Bunbury, by the daughter of Mr B. Pigot. Sub-Inspector Pigot who reports the matter, thinks it is likely this box belongs to the boat Queen of Hearts, the wreck of which was found near where the box was picked up (West Australian, 9 September 1887: 2h & 3a).
It is possible that this actually refers to the finding of the mast and sail on 14 July rather than the vessel itself, as there appears to be no other information on the wreck of the Queen of Hearts having being found.","NO","Unknown","","","","","N","405/71","N","N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Protected Federal","IWorsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

 I have included imagery of the bathymetric Data obtained with approximate measurements of the wreckage.
Although all evidence indicates that this must be the wreckage of A72-80, no definite physical evidence has been obtained from the site.  The intention from the AHO will be to chart the wreckage as a wreck or obstruction with a least depth.  That way at least we can stop someone dropping an anchor on the site.
The position of the majority of the wreckage (main wing) is 14° 02.4897’ South 126° 20.7361’ East, the least depth over this portion of the wreck is 15.76 m in approximately 17 to 17.5 metres of water.  What is believed to be the tail section is located some 31 metres west (true bearing 280°) with a least depth of 16.3 metres in 18 metres of water.
 Pete Locke did make specific comment in his report of visual sighting of a large saltwater crocodile IVO of the wreck, also a number of sharks were also spotted, coupled with a large tidal range and associated strong tidal streams make this a poor area for diving operations to be undertaken.  In addition the water clarity due to the tidal flow movement is also very poor.  It is therefore my assessment that to obtain physical evidence of the wreckages identification is at best high risk.","N","USA","","","","","four engined bomber","","Y","N","-14.041495","","","","126.3456016667","","20.00","A72-80","","Truscott airfield","","","GPS","Unknown","http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/ozcrashes/wa06.htm

The  first example of an outwardbound American China trader to be  examined from the archaeological perspective. Reported in the Columbian Sentinel dated 3 August 1811 to have had
$280 000 in specie on its outward journey from Boston.
Rapid departed Boston for Canton on 28 September 1810. After rounding the
Cape of Good Hope, sailed across the southern Indian Ocean and then
north-east towards North-West Cape on the Australian coast but  was wrecked on the on  98th day of the voyage.  The next day, a storm was raging and the crew set fire to the ship, sacrificing everything so that the wreck would not appear above water and attract other ships to the scene before the Captain could return to save the 280 000 American dollars being carried on board.
The entire crew of the Rapid reached Java alive, though a number died afterwards.
Captain Henry Dorr, his clerk and three sailors survived 37 days of deprivation in
the 16-foot, very leaky jolly boat with only limited rations. They found rats and
crabs to eat on Christmas Island en route to Bencoolen, but no water other than
rainwater that they collected in the sails. Six weeks after arriving in Batavia (Jakarta)
the opportunity of a passage home presented itself. The American schooner
General Greene had lost its captain and most of its crew at Batavia, so Henry Dorr
and part of the Rapid’s crew offered to navigate the schooner to America, arriving
in Philadelphia on 27 July 1811.
Salvage of the specie was a matter of immediacy for the owners of the Rapid. The
town of Boston was already suffering commercial distress, added to which were
the deteriorating relations between America and Britain that eventuated in war in
1812. Most of the specie was salvaged during the months after the wreck, the ship
Meridian transporting c. $91 000 to Canton in 1813, with more held by the salvagers
at Madras and Java.  All but about 19 000 coins were salvaged in the months following the wrecking.
In 1978 a spear-fishing group comprising  F. Paxman, B. Paxman, G. Dromey, and L Paterson discovered the wreck. During three seasons of excavation between 1979 and 1982 archaeologists from the Department of Maritime Archaeology, led by Graeme Henderson surveyed the ship’s timbers and removed the artefacts from within the hull, including  18 548 dollar size coins remaining Spanish silver dollars.   Ship’s fittings, provisions and the personal possessions of crew members had survived in reasonable condition on the site. The hull survey provided sufficiently comprehensive data for the lines of the interior of the vessel to be reconstructed and the exterior to be estimated. The excavation provided information about a vessel type often referred to in the literature but never comprehensively described. A film  ‘Wreck at Madman’s Corner,  popular works and an exhibition at the Shipwreck Galleries ensued.","NO","USA","","2012","","4.30","N","2009/0184/SG _MA-12/78","Y","Y","-22.739438","","31.70","","113.692643","","","","Braintree","Boston","Boston","Canton","+GPS","Protected Federal","Henderson, G.J., 1979, Report on the First Season of Excavation of an Unidentified Wreck at Point Cloates,Western Australia.

Little is known about the Rex, which was owned by Luigi Pittorino of Fremantle and was insured for £800. The value of the fish held aboard, which were lost as a result of the wrecking, was £150.
THE LOSS
The Rex left Geraldton on 25 November on a fishing expedition under the command of John Peterson of Fremantle, with a crew consisting of David Lawson from Mount Hawthorn, and Frederick Gibbon from Geraldton. After the icebox was filled the vessel headed for Fremantle. At 5.30 a.m. on either 16 December (WA, 20 December 1943) or 17 December (DN, 18 December 1943) it lost its propeller and drifted onto a reef near Lancelin Island, was wrecked and sank. The crew used the dinghy to get ashore and then walked south along the beach, going about 20 miles (32?km) before meeting a horseman from the de Burgh homestead. He took the survivors to the homestead and a message was sent from there to the police at Gingin, who came and assisted them to return to Fremantle.","NO","","2","","","","","","N","","","","14.00","","","","","","","Geraldton","Fremantle","Fremantle","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

Built by Francis Smith at Cedar Point in New Brunswick, the Rip arrived in Melbourne on 2 May 1860, 122 days out from Canada. After registering the schooner at Melbourne the owners, Lorimer, Mackie and Rome, sold it only two days later to the Port Phillip Sea Pilots for £4 528. They bought it as a replacement for their pilot cutter Anonyma, which had been wrecked at Londsdale.
On 15 July 1873 near Point Nepean the Rip’s mainsail was struck by a series of tremendous breaking seas which set the schooner on to its beam ends, before carrying away the main mast. One pilot and three crewmen were washed overboard and drowned, and the interior of the vessel smashed. Repairs were carried out at a cost of £1 600.
In 1901 W. Oxley of Melbourne purchased the Rip for fishing in Western Australian waters. In 1904 he sold it to Alex Armstrong of Albany for £350. Armstrong was in partnership with George Waters, and they intended to use the Rip as a lighter, so it was not registered. There were problems in that the vessel was leaking badly due to worm damage in the keel and garboard strakes.
THE LOSS
The Rip was careened in the calm waters of Frenchman Bay in order that an assessment of the damage could be made. This was found to be so severe that the vessel was abandoned as not being worth repairing. However it subsequently dragged ashore, so the owners attempted to burn it. This was only partly successful, with just the seaward side burning. The remains lay broadside on to the beach, canted towards the sea at a steep angle and rapidly began to go to pieces. Howard L. Hartman, in a letter to the Western Australian Museum, states that he remembers fishing from the wreck when he was a child. At that time it still had a great deal of fishing gear inside, suggesting that it was not cleaned out after use as a fishing boat, and may therefore never have gone into use as a lighter.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Rip lies about 100 m south-east from the wreck of the Elvie, closer to the watering place shown on chart BA 2619, and now commonly referred to as Vancouver Springs.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck of the Rip lies in the surf zone in less than two metres of water at the north-western end of Whalers Beach. The overall length of the site is 15.62 m, and there are a number of pieces of timber, including the keel and some frames, together with pieces of charred timber lying on the sand nearby.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
Some of the deck planks from the wreck of the Rip were used soon after the end of World War I to construct a deck on a lighter built by William Douglas on the banks of the Kalgan River. The planks had washed ashore some years earlier.
In March 1999 the wreck of the Rip was inspected by Adam Wolfe on behalf of the Western Australian Museum. Some samples of timber were obtained as well as some tarred felt. The timber was analysed and found to be larch, birch and Eucalyptus melaleuca leucadedron.","NO","Canada","","","","3.48","","2009/0189/SG _MA-501/01","Y","Y","-35.091683","","28.65","","117.943833","","","36660","St John, New Brunswick","","","","GPS 2005","Not protected State","Worsley P. & J.

"Rodondo","1894/10/07","Pollock Reef","Messrs W.H. Patten & Son of Liverpool","Howerd Smith and Sons","Captain Hill","Struck Reef","N","9.20","","Passengers, cargo",""," Rodondo was built at Liverpool by W.H. Potter & Co. and launched in December 1878. Powered by a two-cylinder compound steam engine manufactured by J. Jacks & Co., it had one deck, an awning deck, six bulkheads and three tiers of beams. After taking on passengers at Brisbane and Melbourne the steamer had departed Adelaide on 2 October 1894 under the command of Captain Henry Edward Hill, with a crew of 36 and 164 passengers, including four women and two children. The Rodondo was owned by W. Howard, Smith & Co., and this was its first voyage to Western Australia. The ship was to call at Albany, Fremantle and Geraldton.
Besides the passengers it carried general cargo, and a winding and pumping engine weighing seven tons as deck cargo. Made by Forwood, Down, & Co., it was the property of Cue Victory Gold-Mining Company. It had been loaded at Adelaide for Geraldton, and then onward transport to their mine at Cue. It was placed on the port side 16 ft (4.88 m) from the compass on the ship’s bridge. The gold mining company’s engineer, T.F. Marchant, was a passenger on board.
The ship was fully insured with Lloyd’s of London, and the cargo that had been loaded in Sydney was insured with the Sydney office of Lloyd’s for £720. The engine destined for the gold mine at Cue was also fully insured.
After leaving Adelaide on 2 October the Rodondo rounded Cape Spencer and Captain Hill took his departure from the Neptune Islands, steering west by south, which should have cleared Pollock Reef by 36 miles. There was an easterly variation of the compass but it appeared that Captain Hill did not take this into account:
As a matter of fact his course after leaving South Neptune Island was direct for the reef. On one day he found he was 14 miles north of his course, and the next day 25 miles, and yet the only thing he did to avoid the danger of running into the islands and reefs he knew were ahead was to alter his course a half point south (West Australian, 2 November 1894: 3f-g).
There was a heavy south to south-west swell which tended to push the Rodondo northwards, and an overcast sky prevented sextant sights being taken to fix the ship’s position.
THE LOSS
Shortly before 2.00 a.m. on Sunday 7 October in smooth water the Rodondo, with the second mate, John Francis Le Maistre on watch, struck Pollock Reef. The ship was loaded in such a way that the bow was higher than the stern and it struck the reef about amidships. The captain ordered the engines stopped, and soundings in the aft wells showed that the ship was making water fast. All hands were ordered on deck and the boats got ready. In a very short time the water in the after hold was up to the ‘tween deck. There was panic among some of the passengers and these rushed for the lifeboats. This resulted in the collapse of the davits holding the starboard forward boat, pitching the occupants into the sea where, although 14 were saved, four were drowned. This boat was recovered, and the other boats were lowered safely. The Rodondo had by this time carried on over the reef, and Captain Hill tried to make for the South East Isles intending to beach the vessel. However the steering gear failed and about 12 hours after striking, the Rodondo foundered, sinking stern first about two miles north-east of those islands. By noon all the survivors had been landed on one of the South East Isles (see note below) using seven lifeboats and two rafts. They were mostly poorly clad, many in night dress, and very cold and wet. One of the children, an infant, had been fastened to a lifebuoy and thrown to a seaman. He caught the lifebuoy but the infant fell into the sea. Although immediately rescued the child was in a ‘sickly condition’ as a result of the immersion.
A boat containing the chief officer, Charles E. Halse; third officer, Robert Coe; chief engineer, Henry Wagner; second engineer, A.A. Johnson; donkey-man R. Muir; able seamen J. MacIntyre, W.D. Leitch and F. Cooper; two stewards, H. Mount and J. Charman, and two passengers, Wallis and Edwards, then sailed towards Esperance to seek help. In the fresh north-east wind they reached the south-west corner of Middle Island by 8.30 p.m. and, in order to check their chart, lit a kerosene flare using a lamp thrown into the boat at the last minute. The wind blew out the light almost immediately but the brief flash was just sufficient to be glimpsed by Captain Fred Douglas on the schooner Grace Darling, en route from Esperance to Israelite Bay. He investigated and took the crew of the boat on board and, towing their boat, sailed for South East Island, arriving there about midnight.
The Grace Darling hove to about three miles off the island until dawn, when its dinghy and the boat from the Rodondo were used to make contact with those on shore. However the heavy seas prevented any landing, and the Grace Darling sailed for the other side of the island. Here a second attempt to land was made at 9.00 a.m., but again without success. An hour and a quarter later the first survivors were taken on board the Grace Darling, and by 12.15 p.m. all 36 crew and 160 passengers had been rescued. The schooner landed them at Point Malcolm, where they were cared for by the people at the sheep station which belonged to Messrs Ponton Bros & Sharp.
Three of the passengers, Mrs Couston and her two daughters (one of whom was the infant mentioned above), were taken by the Grace Darling to Israelite Bay where they were looked after by Mrs Ryan, the telegraph station-master’s wife. 
Note: The various newspapers refer to ‘South East Island’ and the ‘South East Isles’. The South East Isles are a group of islands and reefs south-east of Esperance of which only Salisbury and Cooper islands are of any size. As there is no ‘South East Island’, it would most probably have been either Salisbury or Cooper Island (most likely the former) where Captain Hill intended beaching the Rodondo, and on which the survivors landed. The newspapers reported that the island on which the survivors landed was one of the very few on the coast on which water is to be found. However, as it was also a rocky island with no beach, the task of taking off survivors in small boats was very hazardous. The Admiralty Pilot dated 1973 states that the area has not been surveyed. It also reports that Pollock Reef is often very difficult to see ‘beyond the distance of 1 mile owing to the break on the reef being very similar in appearance to the ordinary breaking waves in the vicinity’ (Pilot, Vol. I, 1973: 48).
INQUIRY
In Melbourne the Marine Board held a special meeting on 18 October to consider a report of the inquiry made by their inspector, Captain Drury, into the loss of the Rodondo. A finding was reached that both Captain Hill and the second mate, John Francis Le Maistre (sometimes written Lemaistre), be charged with gross misconduct in the navigation of the ship. A Court of Inquiry into the loss was therefore held at the Custom House, Melbourne, on 22 October 1894. Captain Hill was charged with gross misconduct in the navigation of his vessel by not making sufficient allowances for a current which was shown on the chart, thereby wrecking the vessel and jeopardising the lives of all on board. He was found guilty and had his master’s certificate suspended for 12 months. He was also ordered to pay £20 costs. However the court also recommended that he be granted a first officer’s certificate for the 12 month period. The second mate, Le Maistre, had the charge of misconduct against him dismissed. It was pointed out that no apparent effort was made to beach the ship or rig a jury rudder.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Apart from some of the ship’s papers and chronometers, the rafts and lifeboats (one of which was destroyed in attempting a launching from the island on which the survivors had landed) nothing was saved from the Rodondo. The steamer Flinders departed Fremantle, calling in at Albany to take on food and clothing which had been purchased by the Albany Resident Magistrate, R.C. Loftie, for the survivors. The passengers and crew of the wrecked ship were picked up from Point Malcolm by the Flinders during the evening of 11 October, and left early the following morning for Adelaide. There are a number of newspaper reports of money and other valuables being stolen from cabins during the confusion of the wrecking.","NO","UK","30","","4 or more","4.30","2-cylinder compound steam engine, 150 HP","5/97, 69/72","N","N","","","73.10","","","","","79508","Liverpool","Port Adelaide","Sydney","Western Australian","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

J.E. Kemdo built the Rosella at Broome in 1912 as a lugger (registration number B319) for John Byrne and Martin Richard Freeney, pearlers. At the time it was wrecked the owners were Dennis ‘Dinny’ Ahearn, fisherman of Geraldton, and Mary Agnes Ahearn. The vessel had very likely been acquired as part payment for a farm sold by Ahearn in the Chapman Valley.
THE LOSS
At 11.00 a.m. the Rosella ran on to the rocks at the channel end of the island breakwater while entering Geraldton Harbour. Although the weather was squally at the time the harbour-master, Mr Sinclair, considered poor seamanship to be the cause of the wreck.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Initial salvage included the Rosella’s masts, spars and some associated fittings, and these were subsequently stored in the Burns Philp & Co. Ltd warehouse in Geraldton.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck site is on the seaward side of the island breakwater at Geraldton Harbour.
SITE DESCRIPTION
One of the authors has dived on the site and there appears to be little or no remains of this vessel. The whole area will be severely disturbed as part of the current Geraldton Port upgrading which includes extensive dredging.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
In 1980 one of the authors obtained the main gaff that was then used as the boom on a 10.4?m yacht. Another spar was used at that time to repair the mast of the Robin Gourley designed Britannia, which had been built in 1926.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
SOCIAL (3)
The Rosella, as an Ahearn vessel, had a similar social significance as the Clare and the Britania.

I have to report to the Superintendent of Police that since forwarding the Report of the finding of the wreck of the Schooner Rosette a portion of the cargo has been recovered from the wreck. The mails have also been recovered. Most of the letters are readable, the envelopes are much chafed at the edges.
I am as yet unable to make all of them out clearly.
No further traces have been found of the Passengers or crew.
The hull of the Rosette is much shaken, she has evidently struck on a rock or reef, there is a large hole in her bottom underneath the afterpart of the main hatch. It is believed the hull is not worth floating.

  Runnymede was built by John Watson at Battery Point in Hobart for Askin Morrison, who named it after his estate on Tasmania’s east coast. Registered at Hobart (No. 25/1849) it had two decks, a square stern and a scroll stem. John Watson favoured building vessels from Tasmanian blue gum, Eucalyptus globulus, claiming: ‘I have found blue gum, which grows in great quantities in the forests, equal to English oak in durability, and superior to it on account of the long lengths obtainable’ (quoted in O’May, n.d.: 60). The Runnymede was built from this timber (ibid.: 52), although Huon pine was, and is still, considered Tasmania’s premier ship building timber, and may well have also been used in its construction.
At some time prior to 1874 the Runnymede was purchased by Alex McGregor and James Bayley, the latter commanding the vessel on its whaling voyages for many years. The vessel was still registered at Hobart (No. 7/1874). On 27 October 1881 the Runnymede under the command of Captain J. Travis with a crew of 27 put in to Albany, as the second mate had been badly injured when a whale stove in a boat. This was certainly not the first visit of the Runnymede to Albany, as it is recorded as arriving at the port on 9 May 1876 under the command of Captain Thomas Davis, with 66 tuns of oil on board.
THE LOSS
On Wednesday 14 December 1881 the Runnymede anchored in six fathoms (11 m) at Frenchman Bay in order to take on water. The log for the next four days reads:
Sat, Dec 17th; At daylight a strong breeze from eastwards and the ship rideing [sic] at anchor with 30 fathoms chain. At 10pm let go second anchor and payed out to 45 fathoms.
Sun, Dec 18th; At daylight a fresh gale from eastwards, the ship rideing with two anchors down. 60 fathoms on port one and 40 on the other, regular watches kept. At noon the gale stronger. At 8pm set the sea watches. The Mate headed the first watch. At 15 minutes past midnight parted the port chain got the large anchor and bent it on to the port chain, let it go and paid out 20 fathoms chain on it and other anchor held on without dragging.
Mon, Dec 19th; At daylight rideing with both anchors out. The gale continuede [sic] the same. At 6.30am parted the starboard chain and ship went on shore and the crew were employed saving what they could. At 5pm all hands got ashore safely.
Tues, Dec 20th; At daylight the weather fine and the crew employed gitting [sic] the stores from the wreck. The water about 5 feet in the hold. At sundown the crew came ashore for the night (Dickson, 2007: 587).
It was recorded in several newspapers that the Runnymede was a complete wreck. ‘The crew, stores and oil, were all saved. It is curious that some years ago, another whaler grounded in Frenchman’s Bay under very similar circumstances’ (West Australian, 3 January 1882: 2g). This was the Fanny Nicholson (see entry), and the Runnymede came to rest ‘alongside the few timbers which yet remain to mark the spot where the former disaster occurred’ (Mercury, 27 January 1882: 2a).
INITIAL SALVAGE
 Commencing the day following the wrecking the Runnymede was stripped of everything of any value, and the stores, casks of oil, whaling gear, boat davits, spars, etc., stacked on the beach. After this the men stripped the barque of its rigging, then over the three days 2-4 January the crew set up sheer legs and removed all three masts. These spars were also landed on the beach.
On 7 January 1882 the convict-built whaling barque Emily Downing (Captain McGregor) departed Hobart for Frenchman Bay to recover the material salvaged from the stranded Runnymede. After weathering a succession of gales the Emily Downing arrived at Albany on 1 February. The crew found:
The Runnymede was lying well up on the sandy beach – it being possible to walk round her at low water – and had her starboard side bilged, the port one being alright (Mercury, 21 March 1882: 2).
Some difficulty was experienced in loading the material on board the Emily Downing because of strong easterly winds and heavy surf. The barque finally sailed for Hobart on 25 February, carrying the first and second mates and seven of the crewmen from the Runnymede, arriving at that port on 19 March. Included in the salvaged goods were 16 tuns of oil, 5 boats, spars and other gear. Captain Travis remained at Albany until the sale of the wreck of the Runnymede on 2 March.
In early 1882 William Jenkins Gillam of Albany purchased the wreck of the Runnymede, intending if possible to use it as a coal hulk. He used a new pump specially constructed for the job, the design being based on pumps used at the gold diggings in California. Having previously patched the damaged hull, on Friday 28 April he and his workmen took the pump by steam launch to the wreck site and set it up. They pumped for 3½ hours, lowering the water inside the Runnymede by 25 inches (0.635 m). The following morning they found that the water had risen 10 inches (25 cm) overnight, indicating a small leak. This was found, patched and the stranded barque pumped empty. At that stage of the salvage there were still many tons of ballast to be removed before the hull could be floated into deep water.
The stranded Runnymede was subsequently refloated;
The stranded Hobart whaler Runnymede has recently been floated in Frenchman’s Bay, Albany. It is intended to use her as a coal hulk (Inquirer, 24 May 1882: 5c).
There is some doubt as to what happened to the Runnymede after this. Boocock, et al, 1990, refer to it, after use as a coal hulk, as being returned to Frenchman Bay and burned. This reference, however, occurs in a newspaper only 19 days after the report of the vessel first being refloated. This indicates that despite his intention, Gillam may not have been able to use the Runnymede as a hulk. It is possible that after salvage he realised that the damage was more severe than initially thought, and burned the wreck for the metal fastenings.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Runnymede lies in the intertidal zone on Goode Beach, close to but southward of the wreck of the Fanny Nicholson (see entry).
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck lies parallel to the beach, and is almost always covered in sand and rarely visible. Occasionally the sand shifts enough for the upper part of the wreck to be seen in 1-2 m of water very close to the shore. Howard L. Hartman writing in 1975 stated that some 50 years previously an exceptionally low tide combined with considerable scouring away of sand had uncovered a large amount of the hull. A substantial amount of the below waterline section of the hull is believed to remain in good condition.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
In 1989 and 1993 timber samples from the frames and planking were analysed by the Western Australian Museum and shown to be Eucalyptus species. This would be in accord with the Runnymede being Tasmanian built, and most likely of Tasmanian blue gum, Eucalyptus globulus, a well-known ship building timber. At that time a ballast stone, bottle neck inscribed ‘HVH’ and a fastening were also collected.
Hartman, who was born in 1902 and lived in Albany, says that he recovered some yellow metal and copper fastenings from the wreck of the Runnymede. They were for his father, a bronze caster at a local engineering works. However they proved to be useless as the sea had corroded them.","NO","TAS","","","","4.70","N","2009/0194/SG _MA-446/71","Y","Y","-35.084517","","31.60","","117.937902","","","32032","Hobart","","Hobart","","GPS","Protected State","Worsley P. & J.

No particulars are known regarding this vessel, referred to as a smack by Totty and as a cutter by Loney, except that it was owned by a Dongara fisherman.
THE LOSS
The Saint Mary hit Drummond Rock a little over a kilometre south of Snag Islet. The vessel, with three crew aboard, was en route from Fremantle to Geraldton at the time. After reaching shore in the dinghy two of the crew walked to Dongara, arriving the next day. The third man was partially crippled and remained on the beach without food or water. A rescue party, including an Aboriginal tracker, found him alive but suffering from exposure.
Wreckage of an early 20th century vessel has been found in 3 m of water 10 m south west of Drummond Rock. An excavation has been carried out and a number of artefacts recovered, and it is probable that this is the wreck of Saint Mary.","NO","","","","","","N","115/80","N","N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

Lorah in New Brunswick, Canada, and was described by its owner and master, John Campbell, as being very strongly built. The brigantine was registered at Melbourne in 1878 (No. 6/1878). It was loading jarrah sleepers for Wallaroo in South Australia.
After being stranded during a gale at Lockeville on 15 September 1878 the Salve was salvaged and after a survey the cargo was reloaded and it left for South Australia on 24 October 1878 (see entry).
THE LOSS
The following day while rounding Cape Leeuwin the Salve was caught in another gale, losing the fore topsail yard and springing a leak. To save the crew Captain Campbell ran the brigantine ashore near Augusta in Flinders Bay. All the crew were saved but the vessel was a total wreck.
INQUIRY
In the case of the loss of the Salve, the Court of Inquiry held that ‘Captain Campbell was justified in beaching his vessel to save life’ (quoted in Goldsmith, 1946: 218). The vessel ‘though passed by the surveyors as fit for the voyage was no doubt seriously injured in her bottom’ (Goldsmith, 1946: 219).
INITIAL SALVAGE
There is a report that portion of the deck of the Salve floated ashore, on which was a cannon now in private hands in Busselton. This is 1.5 m in length, has a bore of about 8.9 cm and weighs around 0.5 tonne. It has also been suggested that the cannon may be associated with either the Deadwater wreck or the Grace Darling (see entries).","NO","Canada","","","","5.10","N","112/80","N","N","","","37.50","","","","","","New Brunswick","Wonnerup","Melbourne","Adelaide","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., (2012).

"Samuel Wright","1840/07/08","Koombana Bay","","J.B. Osgood","Francis Coffin","Beached","Y","8.50","","Whale oil","PWD 50976"," Samuel Wright was built at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in the USA, and was partly owned by J.B. Osgood, a merchant of Salem, who was also the manager of the vessel. It had two decks, a square stern, billet head and no galleries. Dickson (2007) states that the vessel’s depth was 13.7 ft, while Henderson (2007) gives this same measurement as its draught. The ship had previously visited the coast of Western Australia in 1837. The Samuel Wright under the command of Francis (Henderson, 2007) or Frederick (Bolton, et al. 1991) Coffin, with a crew of 33, departed Salem on 4 May 1839 to go whaling in the Indian Ocean and along the southern coast of Australia. It called at Albany during March 1840, and had obtained 30 tuns of sperm oil, 36 tuns of black oil and 5 tons of whalebone by the time it anchored in Koombana Bay. Also anchored in the bay were two other American whalers, the North America (Captain Kempton) and the Hudson (Captain J. Denison). Another American whaler, the Governor Endicott (Captain McKinstrey or McKennistry), was lying off Toby Inlet at this time.
THE LOSS
On 6 July heavy rain during the day was followed on 7 July by mild gentle weather. However that evening the breeze freshened from the north-east, increasing and shifting north-north-east. ‘At midnight it blew a perfect hurricane’ (Gazette, 18 July 1840: 3d). About sunrise on 8 July the wind shifted to the north, and at 8.00 a.m. went to the north-north-west and blew with ‘unmitigated fury’. The Samuel Wright rode the storm until the seas were breaking over the topmast head, when a chain anchor cable parted. This left the vessel with two anchors down, and these were not sufficient to prevent the ship from dragging. Another anchor, a very large one, was stowed below decks. The crew attempted to bring this up and secure a cable to it. However the cable was of thick hemp and therefore very stiff, so before they could carry out the task the Samuel Wright struck the beach some miles north of Bunbury. According to Captain Coffin the ship ‘stood all the thumping and went up high and dry, without making a drop of water or starting a single seam’ (Gazette, 18 July 1840: 3d). The storm quickly subsided, and by 4.00 p.m. there was only a light breeze.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The Perth Gazette for 18 July 1840 published the following advertisement on its front page:
Two Wrecks For Sale
Sale of the Wrecks
of the
Samuel Wright
and
North America
at Port Leschenault
On Monday 20th Inst.
The Samuel Wright (Capt. Coffin) and North America (Capt. Kempton), as they now lie wrecks, in the Port of Leschenault, will be sold on the above date, with all their sails, rigging, &c, &c.
Leschanault, July 9
Francis Coffin bought the wreck of the Samuel Wright for £305. The sale, with the Government Resident Henry Bull acting as auctioneer, included all the whale-boats and whaling gear. The wreck must have been in reasonably sound condition as, for a while at least, Captain Coffin leased ‘his old ship for deposit of goods when he can persuade people to deposit them therein’ (Marshall Waller Clifton Letter book, quoted in MA 405/71).
Whale oil and bone salvaged from the wrecks of the Samuel Wright and the North America were also sold. The 30 tuns of sperm oil fetched £50 per tun, the 36 tuns of black oil £9 per tun and £90 per ton was paid for the 1½ tons of whalebone. The monies raised by the sale of the oil and bone were to be paid to the crews of the two ships in accordance with their lays.
In 1842 the crew of the whaler Grotius were shown the wreck of the Samuel Wright by a man who had been a boatsteerer on the whaler, and had settled in the area after the vessel was wrecked. At that time the hull of the ship was still in basically sound condition, but with its back broken from coming to rest on a bar, with the sand being scoured from under the bow and stern sections.
SITE LOCATION
On 27 December 1841 HMS Beagle sailed in to Koombana Bay to collect ‘Mr Forsyth [Charles Codrington Forsyth], whom I had sent over land’…and who had ‘completed the survey of this anchorage, and Leschenault Inlet, which it joins in the south corner by a narrow boat channel’ (Stokes, 1969 (1846): 395). Commander John Lort Stokes goes on to note ‘the wreck of a large whale ship in the head of the bay shows the folly of attempting to ride out the winter gales to which it is exposed…’. This wreck would most probably have been that of the Samuel Wright, which was quite prominent for some years after wrecking, as shown by its inclusion on the Reverend John Ramsden Wollaston’s map drawn on 18 April 1843. On this he also depicted the second North America, wrecked only eight days earlier. It should be noted that in the sailing directions prepared by John Clements Wickham and John Stokes mention is made of the wrecks of both the Samuel Wright and the North America of 1840:
Point Casuarina is the southern point of a small opening, known as ‘Port Leschenault’, from which a reef extends about a third of a mile to the N.N.W., and shelters the anchorage from the westward—this does not appear to be a very secure port, as when we passed in the Beagle at a wide distance from Point Casuarina, two American whale ships were lying on the beach having been driven from their anchorages a short time before, during a N.W.erly gale (Wickham & Stokes 1842: 131).
Stokes’ chart of 1841 shows only one wreck, probably the Samuel Wright.
In December 1962 a mineral sands company operating in the area uncovered three wrecks in the sands of what had been part of Bunbury’s northern beach. It was believed that the northern most one of these was the Samuel Wright.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck of the Samuel Wright is now buried many metres under sand and lies under a carpark at approximately the latitude and longitude given above. When first uncovered by mining operations in 1962 it was found to be standing almost upright, and lying in an approximately north-south direction. The wreck was later reburied.
As the Samuel Wright was not seriously damaged when it came ashore, and came to rest in an upright position, it was able to be used for some time as a storehouse by its owner, the captain turned entrepreneur Francis Coffin. For this reason it seems likely that the hull excavated in 1962–63 and shown in the accompanying photograph is that of the Samuel Wright.

William Owston built the Sara at Point Preston in 1855. Despite being built in Perth and having an official number the Sara does not appear in either McKenna’s or Dickson’s lists of vessels registered at Fremantle. It was carvel planked and had a square stern, scroll head and no galleries. The timber for the construction would most likely have come from near Point Heathcote, some 8 km further up river. William Owston arrived in Western Australia on the Mary in 1851 and set up business at Preston Point. After a maiden voyage from Fremantle to Adelaide and return the Sara, under the command of Henry Christians, went to Port Gregory to load whale oil and copper ore.

After loading cargo the Sara was being towed out of Port Gregory by three whale-boats when a heavy swell set it on a shoal patch between Gold Digger and Hero Passages.

THE VESSEL
The Sarah Burnyeat was built under Special Survey as a barque by Hardie in Southwick, County Durham, UK, in 1862. The vessel had one deck, a square stern, iron frames, wood planking, and was copper fastened and sheathed with felt under yellow metal. It had a raised quarterdeck 8.23 m long and a three-quarter figurehead of a woman. In 1873 it was registered at London (No. 87/1873).
On 3 October 1879 the Sarah Burnyeat had loaded a cargo of jarrah piles from the WA Timber Company at Lockeville, near the Wonnerup Inlet, for delivery to Capetown, South Africa. A strong gale drove it onto the beach where it was condemned as a wreck. The wreck of the Sarah Burnyeat was sold and, despite what must have been extensive damage, the barque was refloated. In early 1880 it was towed to Garden Island by the coastal steamer Rob Roy, arriving there on 4 January 1880. There it underwent extensive repairs during which the rig was altered to that of a brig. After the refit, although the length, breadth and depth remained essentially as originally built, the tonnage was considerably reduced. This may have resulted from the removal of the raised quarterdeck. It was then re-registered at Fremantle (No. 2 of 1881) on 6 September 1881 under the joint ownership of James Lilly of Fremantle and John Marshall of Melbourne, and sailed for Adelaide the following month.
The Sarah Burnyeat arrived in Albany in early May 1882 with a cargo of coal from Newcastle, NSW. In June 1883 Lilly and Marshall sold the brig to The Adelaide Steamship Company, who, in 1886, converted it to a coal hulk to be stationed in Albany.
The engines and steam gear used for lifting baskets of coal had just undergone an overhaul prior to the loss of the Sarah Burnyeat.
THE LOSS
On 28 December 1894 the Sarah Burnyeat was tied alongside the hulk Zephyr, and had been coaling a French mail steamer. There was some 150 tonnes of coal on board the Sarah Burnyeat when, at about 9.00 p.m., a flare which had been used to illuminate the work fell on to the deck. The resulting fire was thought to have been put out, but this may not have been so as early the next morning the hulk again caught fire. Captain Clare, agent for the owners, went with two men to the scene in the tug Escort and succeeded in getting on board the burning hulk. It was impossible, however, to save it so the hulk was towed with some difficulty to a position opposite the Residency, and there beached. The problem during the tow was caused by the fire burning through the tow ropes on several occasions. The Sarah Burnyeat continued to burn all that day until only the bottom of the hull remained. The Adelaide Steamship Company was estimated to have suffered a loss of £1 000, as the vessel not covered by insurance.
The Zephyr had also caught fire, but fortunately this was extinguished by the local pilot, Captain Butcher, and his crew. It had been quickly moved away from the other burning vessel.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Sarah Burnyeat lies in shallow water 500 m off shore from the Residency. Parts of the wreck are visible at low water. The site is marked on current charts as a submerged wreck.
SITE DESCRIPTION
Lying on a gently sloping sandy bottom in only 2-3 m of water, the wreck of the Sarah Burnyeat is 30.2 m long and 6.2 m wide amidships. The wreck lies on a north-east/south-west alignment with the bow pointing towards the shore. It is canted to port, and the lower part of the starboard side of the hull projects about a metre above the sea bed. The port side only projects 20-30 cm above the sand. There are very few timbers visible, apart from some of the floors. A substantial mound of coal has a number of items protruding through it including the lower part of some of the masts, some stanchions and a few timber pieces. A number of iron frames and copper alloy fastenings are visible as well as some of the copper alloy sheathing. As might be expected from the remains of a vessel stripped down to a hulk, there are few non-structural items to be seen.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
In April 1992 a wreck inspection of the Sarah Burnyeat was carried out by Dr Michael McCarthy of the Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
ARCHAEOLOGICAL (4)
The wreck of the Sarah Burnyeat is one of the best preserved and most easily accessible mid-19th century composite hulls in existence in Western Australia. It is relatively stable, being held in that state by the coal, iron frames and marine growth.
INTERPRETIVE (6)
Remains of the Sarah Burnyeat may be seen south of the Residency at times of low tide in Princess Royal Harbour, making it one of the best known and easily accessible shipwrecks in the area.

Sarah Burnyeat (1862-1895)
The Sarah Burnyeat was a two-masted composite-built brig, with iron frames, carvel-built wooden hull, and felt and yellow metal sheathing. It was built in 1862 in Southwick, UK. It was used as a coal hulk in Albany between 1882 and 1894, when it was destroyed by fire. The Sarah Burnyeat had been moored alongside another hulk the Zephyr when it was discovered to be fiercely ablaze at 4.50 a.m. It was decided to cut the Sarah Burnyeat free and beach it opposite the Residency (presently the WA Museum Albany), where it burnt to the waterline. The wreck is still visible above the seabed in shallow water and has remains of its cargo of coal and ballast trapped in the hull.","NO","UK","","1991/07","","4.90","N","2009/0187/SG _MA-7/92","Y","Y","-35.033232","","31.70","","117.876677","","","44221","Southwick, Durham","","Fremantle","","GPS 2005","Protected State","Worsley P. & J.

One of 435 110-foot (33.5m) wooden-hulled submarine chasers built in American yards during World War II for use by the US and allied navies,  SC-751 was one of seven that operated for the USN  in Australian waters as coastal convoy escorts.  From the outset, SC-751 was in command of 34-year-old Ensign  B.C. Davis USNR a highly experienced yachtsman and navigator. He had been appointed to the ship while under construction and after its commissioning on  22 November 1942 he took it on a ‘shake down cruise’ to Florida and then to Panama. There he was joined by Ensign Thomas K. Parkinson USNR as Executive officer with Ensign W.D. Goldfarb USNR as third officer. Eleven of the type entered the Pacific in convoy early in 1943 and after arrival in Nouméa split up for different destinations, including the Solomons and Australia.  Carrying  three officers and twenty four enlisted men SC-751 arrived at Brisbane in company with SC-739 in March 1943 and the two sailed down  the east coast and across the Bight to Fremantle. They then patrolled its outer harbour and approaches and escorted convoys on the west coast. One of these was the famous Royal Shell tanker Ondina
After being attacked in the Indian Ocean by two armed merchant raiders, Aikoku Maru and Hokoku Maru on 11 November, 1942 Ondina a Defensively Equipped Merchant Ship replied with its 4-inch gun and  scored a direct hit on Hokoku Maru. This resulted in an explosion which blew the Japanese ship’s stern off. For its part, Ondina was torpedoed and set on fire.  After  initially abandoning ship the  Ondina crew realised it was not in danger of sinking and they re-boarded it and eventually made Fremantle where temporary repairs were effected. After a decision to base it in Exmouth Gulf as a stationary fuel depot for US submarines operating out of Fremantle,  on June 16 1943 Ondina  set off north with USS Isabel and SC-751 escorting.
From the outset the convoy was beset with turbulent seas, heavy rain and high winds sometimes gusting at  Force Six and Force Seven. According to T.R. Treadwell,  a wartime submarine chaser commander who in 2002 produced a history of the type, conditions were so bad with the storm blowing around 30 knots and at times  with only 500 metres visibility in daylight.  On board SC-751 they succeeded in getting a ‘fix’ at 1525H on 21 June to what they thought was Maud Landing and then they headed due north. The conditions were so bad, however, to produce  serious errors when navigation by Deduced Reckoning and this proved disastrous as they turned  after 0200h on a heading  of 084°T when a full 10 Nautical miles south of  North West Cape. Though expecting to turn east on a clear track past  the Cape into the Gulf, instead they hit the Ningaloo Reef at an estimated 21°56’S.  
 At 0555 the ship struck and grounded fast. . . . Up to the moment of impact, no one had seen any white water breaking over any of the reefs . . .  Reaching the deck while the ship was still bouncing, Captain Davis . . . tried throwing both engines in reverse, but the ship was listing to port. The starboard propeller was beating mostly at air and the port propeller, in contact with the reef wouldn’t budge.. The ship was pounding on her bilge and taking water in the engine room and sound room.
Liferafts were then launched and secured alongside.
At dawn the coast was visible and estimated  ‘three and a half miles away’ ( c. 4Km) and a 12 foot ‘wherry’ (dinghy) was sent ashore with Ensign Parkinson and three crew as the wind dropped to c. 12 knots and the sea inside the reef reduced to a short chop of about 0.5m high. Seeing USS Isabel heading north about a mile to the west they tried to attract its attention with gunfire from its 20mm guns and flares from a Verey (Very) pistol. The Wherry then got into difficulties as the wind again picked up to 30 knots offshore, capsizing half way in.  In being unable to upright it, all bar Ensign Thomas Parkinson, who would not leave the upturned dinghy swam back to the reef landing south of the stricken ship. They then swam and waded back. Still clinging to the boat in the offshore winds Parkinson was swept out to sea past the breakers into deeper water. He then let go of the dinghy and tried swimming back but was last seen swimming outside the breakers, at 1330H  as a heavy rain squall descended.
Throughout the afternoon guns were fired and flares sent off at regular intervals and towards evening the tide rose causing the ship to roll badly to port. Australian troops soon came to investigate the gunfire, thinking  ‘there might be some sort of invasion’ but on seeing the Very flares realised  that a ship was in distress.
The Americans remained on board until 0830 the next day, when in fear of the ship breaking up Davis ordered all to abandon ship. They then walked the rafts over the reef and began  ‘half swimming and half paddling’ to shore.  After making some progress the offshore wind took control and they were blown back towards the reef where they were again beset by the surf.
A PBY Catalina then appeared and after acknowledging their presence it left to unload excess fuel.  At 1430H it returned and effected a difficult landing in choppy seas. The man ‘most of them completely exhausted, badlty cramped, and chilled’ were taken off and flown to the Bay of Rest  in Exmouth Gulf where they were sent on board the  seaplane tender USS Childs for treatment and rest.
On 24 June Davis and Goldfarb went aboard USS Chanticleer, a submarine support vessel and they proceeded down to the site.  After launching a ‘surf boat’ they then approached the wreck from inside the reef.  Together with  officers and crew from Chanticleer they inspected the wreck and hopes  for possible salvage rose, when they  found  it lying on a flat reef that nearly dried at low tide. The ship was  intact bar a hole in the port side at the engine room. They then salvaged all records and ‘gear of a vital nature’ and developed a plan that would entail salvaging everything moveable and then hauling the  lightened  and patched up hull off the reef where it could  be towed to port for repairs
Beginning on 4 July 1943 out of a salvor’s camp on the beach. The main and auxiliary engines were removed, as were all the sonar gear, guns, ammunition and other heavy equipment. After initially failing to float the ship off Chanticleer went to Fremantle for more equipment and on return they found the wreck had been pushed a quarter of a mile north by the seas. Though work still remained difficult and dangerous in periods of low water, they removed the fore and  mainmast, pilot house, shafts, struts, rudders and propellers in order to further lighten the hulk. This work took over two months. At extreme low tides they got tractors out to the reef and proceeded to push the ship onto its starboard side in order to effect repairs on the port side.  Aided by 40 fuel drums hung on the starboard side and   progressively filed with water  they succeeded in  making the vessel roll  and thereby to expose the holes. These were patched and what were described as  ‘Billy pumps’ were  started up to keep water flow to a minimum.  After a number of unsuccessful attempts they were able to manoeuvre the wreck through the reefs using a landing barge, twice grounding and twice getting it off.  The drums, after being emptied were then stowed below deck to help keep the ship afloat. Two and a half months after commencement  the SC-751 was back as sea and was taken taken out towards Chanticleer. The heavy seas and swell did not allow it to be lashed alongside as planned, however and a tow was commenced. Just as they got underway SC-751 began to sink and as the stern rose out of the water it sank in what was described as  ‘fifty-five fathoms’. This all occurred in apposition then estimated as at 21° 56’S.,  113° 53’E.
At the subsequent court of inquiry many discrepancies in the evidence emerged. In mitigation, one expert witness also ‘testified that the strong winds and tides could have played havoc with anyones’ estimated fixes since currents in that area were always capricious, affected by the varying phases of the moon and whether the tide was ebbing or flooding’ (Treadwell, 2002: 132). Davis  was  not held culpable and he was later was transferred to the  7th Amphibious Force and given command of SC 746 taking part in MacArthur’s return to the Phillippines. Goldfarb remained in Chanticleer, eventually rising to Executive Officer and navigator
 The wrecking site and the salvors camp are yet to be found. According to Gerry Lefroy of Exmouth Station legend had it  that  the ship … ‘hit rocks and  was blown up  12-15 miles south of Yardie Creek, North of Carbadaman Pasage’.   In another possibly unrelated account Ted  ( A.G.) McCavana  wrote in the context of the search for HMAS Sydney, of which the NW Cape area file contains other references ( McCarthy, this volume).   In advising of  ‘Articles found on Beach north of Point ‘Cloates 1951-52 or 53’ he stated in a third person way, that …Ted [A.G. McCavana, i.e. himself]  and  “Ken”  . . . an ex navy person decided to take a waterbag and rifle and walk along the beach north. After walking 4-5 miles [presumably from the whaling station]  they discovered a torpedo and wooden boxes which were embedded in the sand they were not able to remove the boxes by digging with the rifle butt, they also saw rusted wire circles, which they felt may have been from HMAS Sydney. Aparently they spoke of reporting this when the whaling season was finished, Ted never reported it & he lost touch with “ Ken” . . .’ It is  possible, despite the considerable distances that the torpedo was a paravane or similar device and that the boxes were related to the salvage of SC 751  ( North West Cape File, WA Museum).","","","","","","","MV","","","","","","33.50","","","","","","","","","","","","McCarthy, M., 2011, Submarine Chaser SC-751 , 1943. .

The vessel was owned and skippered by Peter Fortunado. There were two crew: Giovanni Faneli and Giovanni De Palmo. The vessel was valued at £800 and was not insured.
THE LOSS
The Scotchman was lying at anchor when a storm blew up and the anchor chain broke. The vessel was driven ashore onto a sandy beach where the three crew got ashore safely. This is presumably in the vicinity of Green Islands, given the description in the Police report of ‘on the coast west of Moora’. They walked towards Dongara to get help. After about 32 km they came across George Pigeon at ‘Fatfield’, an outcamp of ‘Myniloo’, owned by Reg Bower. Fortunado and Pigeon rode to ‘Myniloo’ and a buggy was then sent back to collect the two crew who had remained behind because of exhaustion.
INQUIRY
The little information on this wreck comes from the contemporary Police Report. It appears that no formal inquiry was held.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Bower went with two men to the wreck site to see what could be saved, particularly spars, sails and compass. However, there was nothing that could be salvaged as the vessel had washed over two reefs on its way to the shore. This severe battering had led to the vessel being completely broken up by the time Bower was able to reach the site.","NO","","3","","","","","","N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

In 1909 it was owned by Alfred Le Messurier of Port Adelaide and registered at that port. The owner in 1913 was Percy Ayliffe of Carnarvon, although the vessel was still registered in Port Adelaide. The registration was changed to Fremantle during 1913. Frederick Iverson, master mariner of Carnarvon, owned it for some years. He sold the Sea Flower to Cyril Richard Cornish, William Neilson Hancock and Eileen Beatrice Stenning in March 1922. The vessel was used for trading along the coast between Fremantle and Port Hedland.
THE LOSS
The Sea Flower was under the command of Axel Hansen with five crewmen, one of whom, the mate Cyril Cornish, was a part-owner. The other crewmen were Albert Anderson, Oscar Anderson and James Gray. Hansen had 23 years experience of sailing along this coast. The schooner was carrying a cargo of 200 barrels of whale oil and 35 tons of guano for the North-West (Aust.) Whaling Company, a cargo arranged by the agents J. & W. Bateman. The vessel left Point Cloates on 12 September 1923 (see Stanbury, 1985: 16). After three days of fine weather a strong gale from the west blew up and buffeted the vessel for the following four days. It was rolled upside down by a mountainous wave about 8.00 a.m. on 19 September, some four miles from shore. The mate was the only survivor and he estimated the height of the wave at 60?ft. He managed to cling to some wreckage and was washed ashore about four hours after the wrecking. After searching for survivors he made his way inland and after walking about 10 miles came to a farm.
The body of one of the crewmen, Albert Anderson, was found on the beach and an inquest held on 29 September 1923 brought down a verdict of death by drowning.
A wreck has been found in the shallows at the town of Seabird, very likely that of either Sea Bird or Sea Flower, more probably the former. These vessels probably lie very close to each other.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS

Cornish, widow of the sole survivor of the Sea Flower, recently donated the ship’s compass to the Western Australian Museum.","NO","Australia","5","","4","2.90","N","207/80","N","N","","","22.00","","","","","93500","Balmain Sydney","","","","","Protected Federal","Harbour & Light File AN 16/5/ ACC 1066/ 479/1923 and 486/1923 BATT HMC 124/5

"Sea Bird","1874/06/16","Moore River","","Charles Crowther of Geraldton","Charles Hanman","Struch reef during gale","N","5.10","","General","DMH 280","  Sea Bird, described as a ‘little tub of a vessel’ by Jefferson Pickman Stow, was a two-masted schooner with one deck and a sharp stern. The first owner was Henry Yelverton of Vasse. In 1865 it took five of the crew of the small boat Forlorn Hope from Geraldton to Fremantle after their epic voyage from the Northern Territory. Captain Joseph Cooper was the master of the Sea Bird at that time. Yelverton sold the vessel to the joint owners Wallace Bickley and William Richardson in June 1866, and they then sold it to George Shenton (Snr) in October 1866. After his death by drowning on 25 March 1867 the schooner became the property of his son George Shenton (Jnr) who sold it to Charles Crowther of Champion Bay in November 1873.
On 15 June 1868 the Sea Bird dragged its anchor and went aground at Port Irwin. The lighter Albatross was sent from Geraldton to salvage the schooner along with the Twinkling Star, which had also dragged ashore. After successfully completing its task Albatross was swamped on 25 June while trying to return to Geraldton, and eight people drowned. Only two days later on 27 June the Sea Bird was again driven ashore at Port Irwin, but this time it was much more severely damaged. Although there was doubt that it would float again, it was repaired and put back into service. (See the letter from the Resident Magistrate, Geraldton, to the Colonial Secretary in the section on Albatross.)
THE LOSS
The Sea Bird left Fremantle on 11 June 1874 with ten passengers and a general cargo under the command of Captain Charles Gabriel Hanham. The majority of the passengers were ticket-of-leave men. Hanham had taken command at short notice and had not taken a patent log with him. He was not therefore in a position to measure his speed or distance run. The schooner was also unusually flat-bottomed and made more leeway than Captain Hanham realized. After fine weather the wind increased on 13 June. The Sea Bird beat into it for two days, latterly under jib only, until Captain Hanham took it into shelter behind a reef some 5 km from shore, not knowing where he was. On 16 June the wind swung to the north-west and the schooner began to drag its anchors. To save the passengers the anchor chains were slipped and the vessel was run ashore. It went onto the beach about 5.00 p.m. under reefed mainsail, fore try-sail and jib. The vessel was badly damaged with two large holes; one in the bow and one near the stern. It lay broadside on to the beach.
A wreck has been found in the shallows at the town of Seabird, very likely that of either Sea Bird or Sea Flower, more probably the former. These vessels probably lie very close to each other.
INQUIRY
An inquiry was held in Fremantle and Captain Hanham’s Certificate of Competency was suspended for two years because of negligence. He had not taken any sightings, nor had he kept a log book to allow him to make dead reckoning calculations.
INITIAL SALVAGE
All the cargo was saved but much was damaged. The wreck was auctioned at Gingin on 3 August 1874. There is also a record of the wreck having been sold to Lionel Samson on 4 March 1875.","NO","WA","","","","1.90","N","207/80","N","N","","","18.10","","","","","36555","Vasse","Fremantle","Fremantle","Geraldton","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

F. Placanica owned the Sea Prince, which was very similar to Clonen, a lugger purchased by Felice Travia from Dennis Ahearn. It could be assumed that the Sea Prince, which was the same length, and had the same rig and skylight as the Clonen, was probably built by the same boat builder and was in all probability a former pearling lugger. Alfred Edmund Brown built the Clonen and almost certainly built Sea Prince as well. At the time of wrecking the Sea Prince was skippered by Tony Placanica, son of the owner.
THE LOSS
Sea Prince dragged its anchor and went ashore on the east coast of Beagle Island. The cabin and part of the deck were found washed up on the beach half a mile from Dongara. Gaetano Travia, who had taken over the Clonen from his father, identified the wreckage by examination of the skylight. Fear was held for the safety of the crew but they were later found safe, and brought to Geraldton by the fishing boat Clare.","NO","","3","","","","N","115/80","N","N","","","12.20","","","","","","","","","","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

"Sea Queen","1907/03/30","Off Woody Island, went ashore Boxer Island","","W. Clements of Perth","Martin Petersen","Dragged her anchors and went ashore","N","","","","1207, 1059"," Sea Queen is variously described as a schooner, a ketch, and a lugger. It may have been built by Charles Walker, boatbuilder of Fremantle, who was well-known for building luggers for the pearling fleet, as well as cruising and racing yachts. He is known to have built a yawl named Sea Queen. The vessel, owned by W. Clements of Perth, had been chartered by the Australian Phosphates Company to explore the islands of the Recherche Archipelago for guano deposits. As a consequence it was loaded with provisions for three months, a boring plant and mining stores. It was valued at £800, with the stores and equipment worth a further £500. It was not insured.
The Sea Queen departed Fremantle on 19 February 1907. The party had explored Boxer and Figure of Eight islands, and found on the latter a particularly rich deposit of phosphate claimed to be over 50 000 tons.
THE LOSS
During the night of 30 March 1907 the Sea Queen was anchored off Woody Island when the anchor dragged and the vessel went ashore. The vessel was wrecked, and almost all the provisions, boring plant and mining stores were lost. There was, fortunately, no loss of life, but ‘Mr Broadhurst [Florance Constantine Broadhurst], who has had a large share in the Abrolhos guano works, was in this venture also, and was unfortunate enough to severely injure his arm while leaving the wreck’ (West Australian, 9 April 1907: 5i). Some of the group rowed to the mainland and walked to Esperance. From there a fishing boat was sent to collect the remaining survivors.
INITIAL SALVAGE
From contemporary newspaper reports it would appear that almost nothing was saved or later salvaged from the wreck of the Sea Queen. An Extraordinary General Meeting of the Australian Phosphate Company in May 1907 was held to consider the loss of the ketch and all their mining equipment. The meeting considered that the successful exploration results to that date justified spending money on replacing the equipment and continuing the search for further phosphate deposits.
The wreck of the Sea Queen was sold to J.W. White ‘as she lies’. There appears to be no record of the vessel being salvaged by White.","NO","Unknown","","","","","N","3/79","N","N","","","18.30","","","","","","","","","","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

A large scale search was carried out using RAN patrol boat HMAS Assail, RAAF Neptune aircraft A89-281, tugs Rode Zee and Super Tide and oil rig supply boat Cookshore. The bulk ore carrier Musgrave Ranger bound from Darwin to Japan also turned back to join the search. The Rode Zee picked up the 11 survivors. Salvage divers used a diving bell (famously used in the RMS Niagara gold salvage during World War II and reconditioned for the work) to assess the possibility of salvaging the SEDCO Helen but it was considered too dangerous.

Denton, Grey and Company of Hartlepool
and was owned by Bethell, Gwyn and
Company, London. The vessel, well known
as a trader on the Fremantle run, left
London on 14 September 1898. Aboard
were twelve crew and a mixed cargo of
1 200 tons valued at between £1 200 and
£1 400.
Travelling at ten knots on the evening
of 28 December, the Sepia ran before a
strong southerly wind under the main and
topgallant sails. Shipping was seen ahead of the vessel and this was presumed to be
activity at the port of Fremantle. Captain Hugh Thomas was not new to navigation
along this coast. Although no danger was anticipated, as the order was given to
haul up, the barque struck a submerged rock without warning at the edge of Five
Fathom Bank. The vessel sank in less than ten minutes. The speed at which the
Sepia sank made the task of rescuing the crew difficult. Heavy seas were breaking
over the vessel and the cargo had begun to burst through the hatches. The loss of
the vessel was said to have caused ‘a considerable amount of inconvenience to the
firms mentioned, they are depending in great measure upon her for their regular
supplies’.
This site is considered the most complete iron-hulled vessel in the area containing
a well-preserved cargo. The Sepia is representative of the vessels visiting Fremantle,
and the types of cargo imported, in the late 19th century. The Sepia, built in 1864,
is a relatively small vessel compared with contemporary sailers shipping to other
interstate and overseas ports. Yet, as a regular visitor to Fremantle, it is typical of a
late 19th century cargo ship, and analysis of its cargo is expected to provide new
insight into the nature of colonial trade to Western Australia.
Both MAAWA and the Department have conducted work on the wreck. A survey
of a section of the cargo stowage area of the Sepia has been undertaken to identify
and determine the context of a fuller range of late 19th century commodities. It is
anticipated that the position of objects found in situ may be related to those already
in the Department’s collection. In order to interpret the attributes of the wreck
site in a manner consistent with modern archaeological practice, the processes
that led to the deposition of material also need to be understood. In response to
this, site formation analyses have been undertaken to monitor the physical effects
of seasonal change and human impact on the wreck site. There is also a workrelated
programme of wreck inspections of similar sites in the metropolitan area.
Comparison of the cultural assemblages from other contemporary sailing barques
with that of the Sepia will be made to provide a broader view of importations into
the Colony. Site inspections are being made of these wrecks to compare artefact
types and their distribution on site. Literature on this subject includes site plans,
photographs and historical data.","NO","UK","12","2002/12","","5.80","N","2009/0196/SG _MA-447/71","Y","Y","-32.1335833333","","53.90","","115.6418666667","","","48814","Hartlepool","London","London","Fremantle","DGPS","Protected Federal","West Australian, 17 December 1898, p[. 4a

Because of a heavy swell between Rottnest and the mainland yesterday a barge
belonging to the Fremantle Harbour Trust destined to be sunk off the island had to be cut adrift from the launch which was towing it and allowed to wash
ashore at Porpoise Bay, Rottnest. The hawser which was being used to tow the
barge became tangled in the propeller of the launch, which was afterwards towed
to Thompson's Bay, Rottnest, and later back to Fremantle..
The launch Myrtle belonging to the Harbour Trust left North Wharf at 6.40
a.m. yesterday to tow the barge Shark to be sunk off Cape Vlaming, Rottnest.
By 11.30 the launch and barge had reached Parker Point, about four miles
from their destination. The swell was causing the hawser to slacken and tighten
as the barge rode the sea and, with the slackening, the line became entangled in
the propeller and could not be released. The launch was observed from Rottnest,
and a message sent by telephone to Fremantle. The Harbour Trust tender, Ivanhoe, then put out to render assistance. In the meantime, however, the Myrtle
had sent the barge adrift and had been towed into Thompson's Bay by the 30ft.

"Shark","1927/05/08","Went ashore on Mainland","","G. Axel","","","PA","","","","Aus 333, BA 1033 & DMH 018"," Shark was a ketch rigged fishing boat owned by Gus Axel. Axel was in the process of purchasing the vessel from the Government and had insured it for £200. The crew members for this voyage were Aroo Johannes Grannath (in charge), Otto Olsen and Frank Payton. Payton was semi-crippled due to wounds suffered during World War I. The ketch had left Fremantle on 23 April to go fishing and was returning to Fremantle with about 1?000 pounds (455 kg) of fish in the ice chest aboard.
THE LOSS
Due to the approach of bad weather the Shark anchored near Lancelin Island on 6 May 1927. The vessel weathered the north-westerly gale but about 1.00 a.m. on 8 May, when the wind swung to the south-west, the ketch fouled its anchor with the result that Shark went ashore. The port side was stove in and, with waves breaking over the vessel, the crew had considerable difficulty in getting to land.
The three men reached the mainland. Payton was left on the beach while Grannath and Olsen walked across country to the Aboriginal settlement at Mogumber. The Silvery Wave was anchored nearby but neither Grannath nor Olsen would ask for assistance from that vessel as the crew were ‘of a different nationality’. Payton was not so finicky and when the rescue party arrived in a Fisheries Department vessel on 11 May he had obtained from Silvery Wave sufficient food for about 10 days. He had refused an offer to be taken to Fremantle on the Silvery Wave as he expected the other two crew of the Shark to return and rescue him.
When the Fisheries Department launch arrived attempts were made to board the Shark and salvage any gear. This was prevented by the heavy surf that swamped both dinghies, but it was found possible to board the ketch the following day.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The crew had managed to save only a part of their personal belongings when abandoning the Shark. The day following the arrival of the Fisheries Department launch, despite being found full of sand more gear was salvaged as well as the Shark’s dinghy.","NO","","3","","","","","","PA","","","","","","","","","","","Fremantle","","Fremantle","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

"Solglyt","1901/09/12","Koombana Channel","M. Suensen","O. R. Foreid","Captain A. Rasmussen","Beached","Y","5.00","","Jarrah","AUS 334"," Solglyt was built by M. Svensen in Grimstad, Norway, with one deck, two tiers of beams and had been sheathed with yellow metal. Described as being of shapely appearance, it was principally owned by Captain A. Rassmussen and his brother, and was insured. Captain Rasmussen was the master, with a crew of 13 and three passengers when it arrived in Koombana Bay from Port Natal on 18 May 1901. It loaded a cargo of jarrah for the Port Natal Harbour Board and the Port Natal Railway. This consisted of 10 935 pieces, including 81 piles 12.2–16.8 m long, plus sleepers and other timber. The cargo was shipped by George Baxter, who had gone to great lengths to select ‘the best samples ever shipped at this port’ (Bunbury Herald, 13 July 1901: 2a), and was valued at £2 500.
THE LOSS
The Solglyt was anchored with two anchors down preparatory to departing for South Africa. The weather was described as heavy with the wind blowing strongly from the north and north-east, accompanied by squalls and strong tides, which lasted nearly all day. Captain Rasmussen tried to kedge out to a heavy mooring buoy, but a squall struck and one of the anchor cables parted. During the afternoon the vessel was driven back, and finally grounded in shallow water, settling ‘across the reef on which the Agra was wrecked about five years ago’ (Bunbury Herald, 13 July 1901: 2a). It commenced to bump heavily and soon started to fill with water. At midnight a ‘tempestuous wind was blowing accompanied by heavy rains, and although distress lights were burnt nothing could be done to relieve the vessel, while the absence of a steam tug rendered the process of pulling her off quite out of the question’ (Bunbury Herald, 13 July 1901: 2a). The following day the vessel had completely filled, with water running over the starboard side. The stern of the barque was still bumping.
The Harbour Master, John George Abrahamson, wrote to the Chief Harbour Master at Fremantle, Captain Charles Russell:
I beg to state that early morning on the 10th instant…the Captain of the Norwegian barque Solglyt, in trying to haul his vessel out towards a heavy mooring buoy, to which he had run a line in preparing to go to sea, the vessel was caught with a sudden strong wind from N. to N.E. and drifted down towards the shallow water; he let go both anchors and hung on, but as the wind increased he dragged further in, at about 3.30 p.m. of the same day. Captain came ashore, informing me that his vessel was touching ground aft. I went out with two Norwegian shipmasters in my own boat. At about 9 p.m., in a terrific squall, vessel dragged her anchors further in, and was bumping heavily. Captain was paying out cable and reported 4 ft. of water in the hold… At about 2 a.m. on 12th (Friday), as the tide rose, she canted slightly with her stern to Eastward, and sank at her anchors in 20 ft. of water aft, 21.6 ft. forward and amidships at low water (Fremantle Harbour-Master’s Letterbook, 12 July 1901, quoted in Fall, 1972: 138).
On Friday 12 July 1901 the Lloyd’s surveyor, Captain Webster, arrived and, after inspection, pronounced the vessel a total wreck. The following day a diver was sent down to locate the exact position of the damage.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Some of the timber had been off loaded and lightered ashore before the Solglyt finally settled on the sea bed. On 18 July 1901 the wreck of the Solglyt ‘as she now lies submerged in Bunbury Harbour. All sails, gear, and boats on board, and on shore, at the same time the cargo of about 715 loads on board and 35 loads landed of jarrah timber, consisting of piles, timber, sleepers, etc.’ (Bunbury Herald, 16 July 1901: 3d) was sold by an auction. This was conducted on the Bunbury Jetty by James Moore. The sale realised £75 for the vessel and £125 for the cargo, being bought by Mr Rohr. Mr Jones paid £3 for the praam, Mr Orr £16 10s 0d for a double-ended lifeboat, Mr G. Hayward £5 for a jolly boat, and the longboat was sold to Captain Griffs for £8 15s 0d. Other items were sold at the Customs shed, the total from everything sold being £340. The timber already ashore had a lien on it of £60 payable to Messrs Millar Bros for lighterage, but no offer was made.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Solglyt lies buried near the channel between Koombana Bay and the Leschenault Inlet. It was uncovered during excavations for that channel at Point McLeod in 1973. Badly damaged by the bulldozers, the remains were buried nearby.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS

THE VESSEL
Described as a Blackwall frigate, and launched in March 1861 as a fully rigged ship by T. & W. Smith, the Saint Lawrence had two decks, an elliptical stern, quarter galleries, a poop 22 m long and a forecastle 12.2 m in length. Copper fastened, sheathed with felt and yellow metal, it had ‘hollow garboards, a good rise of floor, round bilges and considerable tumblehome; otherwise she was of a short and rather full-bodied model’ (MacGregor, 1988: 66). Lubbock states that the:
St Lawrence, the last of Smith’s fleet, was considered the finest and latest thing in wooden passenger construction. She had so much rise of floor that she required 60 tons of ballast to keep her upright. She was very short and beamy when compared to other ships of her year, but was a very fine sea boat, dry and yet easy in her movements …she was a beautiful ship in every way, and well upheld the reputation of the Blackwall frigates (Lubbock, 1922: 275).
The term ‘Blackwall frigate’ was a generic name given to a series of sail trading ships built in the mid 19th century for the Indian trade. They got their name because many of them were built at Blackwall on the River Thames, and ‘frigate’, because of the fine run to the hull, making them faster than other vessels of that time. During the 1860s the Saint Lawrence was used to take troops and other passengers between Britain and India. The vessel had undergone damage repairs in 1875 which included replacing part of the deck. In 1878 further damage repairs were carried out, and at this time the rig was altered to that of a barque. In May 1882 the Saint Lawrence was sold to Maklon Clarke Colishaw of Sydney, and registered at that port (No. 26/1882). Under his ownership part of the poop was removed in January 1884, reducing the net tonnage from 1 062 to 1 019 tons. Colishaw sold the vessel to James Riddle Muirhead of Sydney in March 1888.
In March 1889 the Saint Lawrence, under the command of Captain Thomas Brodie Pow with nine crewmen, was struck by a storm off Cape Leeuwin en route Newcastle, NSW, to Fremantle. Under only two topsails the barque was rolling heavily when the channels gave way, and both main and mizzen masts snapped and fell. In falling the masts smashed four of the ship’s boats and caused a considerable amount of other damage. The man at the helm was struck by some of the falling gear and injured. By luck the rest of the crew, apart from the captain, were below decks, having been sent there only three minutes earlier for coal. Had they been on deck ‘they would have been standing where the wreckage came down’ (Albany Mail, 27 March 1889: 3d). With only two sails set the Saint Lawrence turned and ran for Albany. It was sighted by the lighthouse keeper on Breaksea Island heading east early on the morning of 25 March 1889. He sent a message to Albany and the tug Jessie left port to find the distressed vessel. It was located at 10.30 p.m. that night and towed into port, arriving at 1.30 a.m. the following morning. The cargo of coal was discharged and sold locally. The barque was subsequently sold by the New Zealand Insurance Company in Perth to John Moir and Company of Albany, for use as a hulk. The hulk was hired by The Adelaide Steamship Company Limited for the period 1890 to 1893. An auction of the hulk Saint Lawrence ‘built of teak, copper fastened, well found with boiler, winch, derricks, anchors, chains, and general gear. Now at anchor at Albany’ (Albany Advertiser 1 November 1898: 2c) was to be conducted by John Muir and Company on 2 November 1898 at the Freemasons Hotel. There are no subsequent newspaper references to this auction or to the Saint Lawrence.
THE LOSS
At some unknown date in late 1898 the hulk Saint Lawrence caught fire, was abandoned and sank in Princess Royal Harbour. Given the above information it would appear that the hulk caught fire on either 1 or 2 November resulting in the loss of the Saint Lawrence, and therefore the cancellation of the auction.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
During port dredging operations in 1977 a burnt wooden wreck was located. This was most probably the remains of the Saint Lawrence.
The binnacle from the Saint Lawrence is held by the 1st Pelican Point Sea Scouts on the Swan River at Crawley.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
ARCHAEOLOGICAL (4)
The remains of the Saint Lawrence could provide valuable information on the construction of Blackwall frigates over 150 years ago.
RARE (7)
The Saint Lawrence was built as a Blackwall frigate and as such is a rare example of this type of vessel in Western Australia.
REPRESENTATIVE (8)
The Saint Lawrence is representative of the many coal hulks used to bunker the steamers calling at Albany.

The St Lawrence was a Blackwall Frigate type wooden sailing ship of 1049 tons, built in 1861 by T. & W. Smith of Newcastle on Tyne, U.K..
Blackwall Frigates were a class of wooden ship known for their fine lines and speed on long distance runs to the East and West Indies, and Australia. After 1868 the St Lawrence was trading as a cargo ship along the Australian coast, and during this time in 1889 was dis-masted off Cape Leeuwin during a gale. Two sailors were killed when the masts came crashing down, and the ship was navigated to Albany under jury rig. The Adelaide Steamship Company then used the St Lawrence as a coal hulk in Albany between 1889-1898. The St Lawrence caught fire and was abandoned in Albany Harbour in September 1898, and remains of a burnt out wooden wreck that may have been the St Lawrence were found during port dredging operations in 1977.","NO","UK","","","","6.50","N","195.72","N","N","","","54.60","","","","","29115","Newcastle-on-Tyne","Albany","Sydney","Fremantle","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

Stang","Carl Bech","Struck reef","Y","16.50","","Cement and  coke","1056, 333","   Stanford was a two-decked steel motor vessel, built at Helsingor in Denmark by Helsingors Jenskibs-og Maskinbyggeri, Actieselskabat in 1928. It was fitted with a 12-cylinder diesel engine made by Burmeister and Wains-og Skibabyggerri, Actieselkabat of Copenhagen, Denmark, and rated at 543 NHP. Owned by J.B. Stang of Oslo, Norway, the ship had been built especially for trade with Western Australia. There was refrigerated space for fruit as well as general cargo holds. The Stanford’s service speed was 11 knots and it had a cargo capacity of 8?375 tons.
The Stanford departed Rotterdam on 5 May 1936, and was due to load wheat and timber at Bunbury for the return voyage to Europe after discharging its cargo in Western Australia. Under time charter to Westralian Farmers Ltd, it had discharged 6?000 tons of cement and 600 tons of coke at Fremantle before heading to Geraldton where it was to discharge the remaining cargo. This consisted of 1?300 tons of coke for the Wiluna goldmine and 600 tons of cement for Geraldton. The master was Carl Beck (spelt Bech  in some news items)  and there was a crew of 31, including one Australian, and two passengers, Mr Douglas James Jeans and Mrs Evelyn Dorothy Jeans from England. Mrs Jeans was 6 months pregnant at the time. The Stanford was valued at £80?000 and the cargo at £20?000 at the time it was wrecked.
THE LOSS
The Stanford went aground on African Reef about 9.40 p.m. on 24 June 1936 in poor visibility due to heavy rain, haze and intermittent squalls. The master had got a good position sight at noon, and during the rest of the day had been ‘lifting’ the ship to keep it away from the shore. The Point Moore lighthouse was not seen until after the ship struck the reef in heavy seas. After the vessel struck, attempts were made to get it off using the helm and putting the engines astern, then ahead, but without success. The Stanford had hit between numbers 1 and 2 hatches and began taking water. With the steering gear smashed, the rudder broken and the seas getting rougher, a radio message for help was sent out but the request for a boat from Geraldton to take off the passengers was not complied with. Fortunately, the State Ship Koolinda under Captain George Buckeridge had also picked up this message.
The Koolinda made best speed to come to the aid of the Stanford and was standing by at daybreak on 25 June, but due to the reefs in the area and the rough weather it had to stand off some miles out to sea. The starboard lifeboat from the Stanford was launched and took the two passengers and fifteen of the crew to the Koolinda, a four mile row, where the people in it were hoisted aboard. Captain Beck had meanwhile advised the Koolinda that he could not launch another lifeboat due to the heavy seas and the list of his vessel. A lifeboat from the Koolinda under the command of Chief Officer Humble was therefore lowered and sent in to rescue the remaining crew aboard the Stanford, together with the ship’s cat and her three kittens. The rescue was completed by 11.30 a.m., despite the heavy weather that made it difficult for the crew to sail and row the lifeboat to the Koolinda, by then some five miles from the wreck.
The residents of Geraldton had realised that the Koolinda would not be able to get close to the Stanford because of the reefs and rough seas and so made preparations on shore opposite the wreck in case Captain Beck should choose to make for the beach in the lifeboats, rather than attempting to reach the Koolinda. Kerosene-soaked beacons of driftwood were readied to guide any boat in. Ropes were laid out to enable men to wade into the surf and drag occupants of the boats ashore. In the event these preparations were not required, as Captain Beck considered that an attempt to take a lifeboat ashore through the reefs and surf would have resulted in loss of life.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Four days after the wrecking Captain Beck and representatives of the charterers, customs and insurers were taken by fishing boat to inspect the wreck. The inspection was brief due to bad weather, but some personal effects of the officers were recovered together with the ship’s chronometer. Various people recovered a considerable quantity of ship’s fittings, navigation instruments, radio and stores on subsequent visits to the vessel as the weather improved. These were stored in the King’s Warehouse under control of HM Customs. There were also a number of items that washed ashore, some of which also came under Customs’ control. Because of looting of the vessel, Customs hired a watchman, N.G. Armstrong, to patrol the beach to discourage this practice. Armstrong, was paid 2s 6d per hour with an extra 5s per day for the hire of a horse. His duties were subsequently taken over by two Customs officers from Fremantle, E. Walker and T. Ingram. The Sub-Collector of Customs placed an advertisement in the local Geraldton newspaper on 21 October 1936:
All persons are hereby WARNED that any flotsam or jetsam found from the m.v. ‘Stanford’ wreck is to be forthwith reported to the Customs. Under the Customs and Navigation Acts heavy penalties are provided against the unlawful removal of such flotsam or jetsam, or portions of the wreck.
By the end of the year there was a considerable quantity of goods held in bond. Customs valued all these items, and the following are some of their valuations for duty:
One Chronometer	£5
One Azimuth mirror	£1
One Pelorus		£2
One ship’s boat 20ft	£8
3 ship’s compasses	£6
Navigation charts	£1 10s 0d
Other goods salvaged included galvanized buckets, radio parts, blankets, coils of rope, cabin lamps, engine parts, 5 quarts of gin, 4 quarts of whisky and one each of Aquavit and Punsch and 14 small bottles of tomato sauce and ‘1 old tarpaulin’. The total value for duty of these goods was £57 0s 6d and the duty payable was £35. The ship’s radio and spare parts were valued separately at £15. The radio was old and of a type no longer permitted to be installed on ships, so the value was calculated only on its use for serviceable parts. Some of the passengers’ luggage and personal effects of the crew were also recovered and sent to Fremantle.
Adolfo Calligaro of Bootenal purchased the wreck, including the items held in bond, for £450 on 27 October 1936. He was also required to pay £9 18s 1d for rent and other charges at the Customs warehouse. Crooks & Brooker Ltd immediately offered him £35 for all the salvaged items except the ship’s navigation instruments and wireless gear. An offer of £5?000 for the wreck by a Japanese salvage company was withdrawn the day before signing, when a storm destroyed the Stanford and washed the wreckage off the reef.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Stanford is on the central of the three reefs comprising the African Reef complex. It lies scattered in 5 m of water, mainly on the seaward side of the reef
SITE DESCRIPTION
The reef is subject to dangerous swells which break and so diving conditions are safest in calm seas.
Divers are advised that the wreck of the Stanford was used for bombing practice during World War II, and therefore the site may contain unexploded ordnance. If it looks like a bomb it may well be a bomb!
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
There has been no systematic excavation of the site, but amateur divers have removed numerous artefacts over the years. A bronze propeller was raised in the late 1960s and another, which is now on display in the grounds of the Western Australian Museum Geraldton, was recovered in 1998. Both ship’s bells and a water pump from the Stanford have been donated to the Western Australian Museum. Doors were used at the now abandoned Bootenall Convent, and in the Bootenall Brickworks engineroom. Some of the timber off the Stanford was also used for the construction of a bridge at the brick kilns. The ship’s navigation lights hang outside the Mission to Seamen, and the convent in Geraldton has a four-drawer bureau that is thought to be from the wreck.

However, in the WA Times of 12 May 1876: 3a, the owner, Wallace Bickley, hotly disputes this, stating that the Star left Shark Bay on 29 April, arrived Geraldton 3 May and left Geraldton 5 May.
According to Perth newspapers the 5-ton cutter Star arrived at Fremantle on either 14 or 15 May (depending on the paper).  All the newspapers report that it called in at Shark Bay after earlier leaving Port Walcott, and that the skipper was R. Maxworthy (presumably Richard Maxworthy, ex-RN, ex-pilot).  Therefore the Star is not a shipwreck as previously recorded in Unfinished Voyages (Henderson) and Windswept Coast (Worsley & Worsley).","NO","WA","3","","4","2.30","N","","N","N","","","24.10","","","","","","","Shark Bay","","Geraldton","","Protected Federal","Resident Magistrate, Geraldton, to Col.

schooner Star was built in 1876 by veteran
Fremantle boat builder Thomas Mews
for local merchants J. and W. Bateman.
Batemans initially were unsure as to where
they would employ the Star and decided
to send her to Batavia with a cargo of
jarrah. However, it seems that the vessel
was utilized as a whaling vessel instead, as
by late 1877 it was whaling initially at the
Rosemary Islands (which had been fished
previously by overseas whalers before the
settlement of Western Australia). The Star’s initial whaling venture was a success
with a return to Fremantle of 147 casks of oil. During mid 1880, the Star was fitted
out for a short whaling expedition south of Fremantle to Geographe Bay. On 28
February the Star left port under the command of Captain John Sheppard with a
crew comprised of Malays. The vessel was equipped with two whale boat crews and
a spare whaling hand (although these had nothing to do with the sailing of the
vessel). After an unsuccessful whaling trip to Geographe Bay, Captain Sheppard
sailed north of north-east for the Rottnest Island light, heeding the warning of
Bateman not to steer a too easterly course. At 1 a.m. the Captain altered the
vessel’s course two points to the east assuming this would head the vessel toward
the north end of Garden Island. Unfortunately at 3 a.m. breakers were sighted off
the starboard bow. The Captain removed the Malay in charge of the wheel, but
only succeeded in jamming the wheel down in the confusion. The schooner at
once swung toward the reef striking it violently. The wreck lies about 3 km south of
the Sisters Rocks on the Murray Reef. It was reported to have sunk with its whaling
gear aboard.
The site lies in c. 2.7 m of water on the Murray Reef. An excavation of the site
was carried out by the Museum in 1983, with assistance from local divers keen to be
involved in such a project. Since this was the first locally-built ship to be investigated
by the Museum, the main interest was the hull—found to be in good condition and
made of local wood. After analysis, these were determined to be jarrah, a sapwood,
red mahogany and red gum (the latter two possibly of New South Wales origin).
No whaling equipment was found, but large pulleys indicated a need to lift heavy,
bulky cargoes. Among the artefacts recovered were a brass ship’s log, a penny dated
1876 and various types of ceramic wares. The Star is significant because: it was the
first locally-built vessel; it was associated with local merchants and ship owners,
Batemans; and, it had a direct role in the whaling industry of Western Australia.
During the latest site inspection, in 2004, it was noted that very little of the vessel
remains at the site, the remains having been broken up or degraded by the high
energy environment.","NO","WA","","1991/12","","2.30","N","2009/0200/SG _MA-19/73","Y","Y","-32.3765","","24.10","","115.6838333333","","","72482","Fremantle","Fishing ground","Fremantle","Fremantle","GPS","Protected Federal","Western Australian Times, 10 March 1876 and 23 November 1877

Star of the South was built at Bunbury by James Dagley Gibbs for James Moore of Bunbury (32 shares) and Maurice Coleman Davies, a prominent timber merchant (32 shares). The cutter had one deck and a square stern. In April 1883 the vessel underwent a refit, during which it was lengthened, the stern changed to a counter, the tonnage increased, and afterwards the vessel was reregistered. In January 1884 Davies sold his half share to Moore. On 12 June 1885, during the gale that also stranded the Paragon, the cutter was driven ashore near the Busselton Jetty. It was refloated and repaired.
The Star of the South was being used to bring guano from Lancelin and Wedge islands (often referred to at the time as the Guano Islands), and had arrived in Bunbury in the evening of 23 June 1888 with 15 tons of guano on board.
THE LOSS
The Star of the South was at anchor at Bunbury when, on 25 June 1888, a fierce gale struck from the north. With waves breaking over the jetty the cutter parted its cables and blew onto the bar of the Leschenault Inlet where, with the wind continuing and a falling barometer, it was wrecked.","NO","WA","","","","1.60","N","405/71","N","N","","","14.20","","","","","75297","Bunbury","Lancelin, Wedge Island","Fremantle","Bunbury","","Protected Federal","IWorsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

It was powered by a 20 HP engine manufactured by Patterson & Atkinson of Newcastle-on-Tyne.
The Start under the command of Captain Allen left Melbourne for Fremantle on 20 August 1878, and on 29 November a Perth newspaper reported:
Fears are entertained for the safety of the small screw steamer Start, belonging to Messrs W.D. Moore and others, which left Melbourne for Fremantle as far back as the 20th August last. She was, when out about a fortnight, spoken by the Cleopatra on her passage from Melbourne, and the master, Captain Allen, reported the machinery had broken down and that he would have to make the remainder of the voyage under sail. Nothing has been seen or heard of her since (WA Times, 29 November 1878: 2c).
THE LOSS
On 18 March 1879 a newspaper reported that ‘the stern plate of a boat, and an oar, both branded Start’ (WA Times, 18 March 1879: 2d) had been discovered on the beach at Israelite Bay a few days earlier. The items had evidently been found by the assistant telegraph operator at Israelite Bay, a man named Scott.

Stefano  
From a social perspective the wooden-hulled three-masted 857-ton Austro-Hungarian barque Stefano (1873-1876) is one of the most significant of all the colonial-era wrecks in Western Australia.
After loading 1300 tons of coal at Cardiff in Wales Stefano left for Hong Kong at the end of July 1875 with 17 crew, the eldest at 25-years-old, was the ship’s master. All were from Croatia, bar an English boy. Whilst sailing at an estimated 9 knots the ship struck the Ningaloo Reef  south of Point Cloates,  on 26 October and in the ensuing storm seven were drowned. The others made it to shore, clinging to wreckage or on upturned boats, thus commencing a saga that was to become one of the greatest shipwreck survival stories for two of them—Miho Baccich, who was then 16 years old and Ivan Jurich, who was 20.
After  landing the survivors eventually headed south for the Gascoyne River with the assistance of Aborigines who, though not able to be understood, provided a map  that had washed ashore, food  and water.  On reaching Cape Cuvier they were presented with a vision of extremely desolate country and  blinding reflections from the salt lakes.  With very little water remaining they turned back only to have a cyclone hit the camp. In becoming totally disoriented, exhausted and separated all Baccich and Jurich died.  With no hope remaining, the two survivors headed inland and found the Aborigines who had earlier assisted them. Nursed back to health, on occasions even carried by the women until their strength returned, for three months the boys were assimilated into the group, learning a great deal about the land, the animals, the customs, ceremonies and language. On 18 April they were picked up by the pearler Charles Tuckey in the  cutter Jessie.  He took them down to Fremantle where they were feted before heading back north with  gifts for their saviours. Later they were repatriated to Rijeka where they provided their story to Father Stefano  Skurla who had been commissioned by Baccich’s parents to record the story. They also commissioned a painting showing Tuckey rowing ashore from the Jessie towards the  assembled group. This painting still  hangs in  the church of Our Lady  of Mercy in Dubrovnik.
Using visual  tow search methods, the  Stefano was found by a museum team in 1997 and a number of objects including a bell and a starboard lamp were recovered. These now feature in an exhibition entitled  ‘Strangers on the Shore’  celebrating the generosity of the  Aboriginal people.

On 27 March 1892, while in Admiralty Gulf, the yacht developed a leak which was not able to be repaired. The Captain endeavoured to run ashore but the ship became stuck fast on a mudbank near Osborne Island. Captain and crew took to the ship’s boats and landed at Dicky Bay where a number of pearling schooners were stationed. The Captain then decided to go to Broome in the ship’s whaleboat taking nine of the crew, to inform the owners of the loss of the Sunbeam. This was against the advice from the other pearlers. On their way to Broome, at one stage they tried to go ashore, but they were chased off by spear waving Aborigines. There are two legends about the fate of the ship, one from a European point of view, and the other from the Aboriginal perspective. The European story is that the ship was elderly and the leak arose from corrosion in the hull. The Gamberra or Miwa  people have a different tale. In the pearling areas it was not uncommon for men on these ships to borrow or steal Aboriginal women. Prior to the loss of the ship, the Sunbeam crew had apparently been allowed some Aboriginal women for an agreed time which the crew ignored. The Aboriginal men were understandably angry about this and proceeded to “sing” the ship, to call upon serpent spirits to sink the ship. Thus the story of the Sunbeam has  entered Aboriginal legend.","NO","UK","","1989/10","","3.10","Compound 18 HP","2009/0203/SG _MA-168/76","Y","Y","-14.35","","28.00","","126.025","","","44867","Blackwall, Middlesex","England","Hull","West Australian","","Protected Federal","Inquirer, 16 July 1890, p. 4g and 8 October 1890, p. 7b

"Swift","1896/08/31","1.2Km Metres offshore Twilight Cove","","J.R. Conolly, Esperance Bay","John Cockcroft","Struck rock during voyage","N","6.20","","",""," Swift was built by S. Griffiths on the Mersey River in northern Tasmania. It had one deck, a round stern and a scroll head. It was built with a centreboard, a fairly unusual feature for coastal trading vessels in Australia. The centreboard and its case took up the equivalent of 0.89 tons of space. It was owned by John Thomas Shimmins (or Skinner), master mariner, and registered at Hobart. On 19 June 1896 it was purchased by John Richard Arthur Connolly of Esperance. He registered the ketch at Fremantle (No. 1/1896). Under the command of Captain John Cockcroft the ketch was delivering enough material for 65 miles of the overland telegraph line between Eyre and Ponton’s station along the south coast. This was to be landed at Twilight Cove.
The Swift had a reputation for being difficult to steer unless all sail was set. This made it unusual amongst Tasmanian-built ketches of the late 19th century, which were generally well regarded.
THE LOSS
The Swift was sailing under full sail in a fresh south-west breeze into Twilight Cove from the south-west with a crewman taking soundings. The man reported two and a half fathoms (9.6 m), but before he could again cast the lead the ketch struck a flat rock. The heavy sea carried the vessel over that rock and onto another. The Swift began leaking badly, and was abandoned by the crew, all of whom reached shore safely. After the Preliminary Court of Inquiry had been completed at Esperance, Captain Cockcroft and some of his crew travelled to Albany on board the coastal steamer Macgregor, arriving there on 23 September.
INQUIRY
A Preliminary Court of Inquiry into the loss of the Swift was held at Esperance on 21 September 1896. Captain Cockcroft’s evidence showed that the ketch struck a rock which was not shown on the chart. At the hearing evidence was given that the Swift ‘was unmanageable unless under full sail’ (West Australian, 23 September 1896: 5a). The members of the preliminary hearing decided to charge Captain Cockcroft, but the subsequent Court of Inquiry exonerated him from blame.
INITIAL SALVAGE
A telegram sent from Eyre to the Postmaster-General by the officer-in-charge of the telegraph construction party stated that up to the morning of Monday 7 September, 35 tons of material from the wreck of the Swift had been recovered. Conditions were difficult:
Since Saturday the salvage operations had been hampered by heavy surf at the wreck, and the only boat remaining had been stove in. A raft had, however, been made, and with this it was hoped, if the weather permitted, to bring the balance of the material ashore in a day or two (West Australian, 9 September 1896: 4g).
SITE LOCATION
The coast here is moving out to the sea at the rate of a little over 3 m a year. The Swift is now situated 55 m inland from the first sand ridge above high water mark. In May 1977 the wreck was inspected by Scott Sledge of the Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum. At a depth of 90 cm fresh water entered the archaeologists’ trench causing the sides to collapse, which seriously hindered a full inspection.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck of the Swift lies on its starboard side roughly parallel with the shore line, bow towards the east-north-east. The stern is buried under a large sand ridge, and the port side has collapsed. The measurable length of the site is 19.7 m with a width of 3.6 m amidships. The frames measure 140 mm by 110 mm with an average spacing centre to centre of 400 mm. The ceiling planking is 60 mm by 300 mm and most of the fastenings are of iron. A substantial part of the hull is still intact, and the timber appears to be in excellent condition. There are an iron hawse pipe, two iron cog wheels believed to be part of the windlass, two iron knees and other artefacts at the site.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
Three samples of the timber were collected, together with a number of the iron fastenings of different sizes.","NO","TAS","","","","2.20","N","6/86, 102/91","N","N","","","25.80","","","","","79260","Mersey River","Albany","Fremantle","Eucla","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

The Bruce was built by Ernest and Charles Dunn at Berry’s Bay on the north shore of Sydney Harbour. The steamer was cutter-rigged having one deck, three bulkheads, an elliptical stern and a billet head. The engine by Moss & Duncan of Govan, Scotland, produced 25 nominal horsepower and was fed steam from a steel boiler operating at 120 lbs/sq. in.
The first owner of The Bruce was John Frederick Tasman Hassell of Albany, and it was registered at Fremantle (No. 5/1898). On 1 July 1898 it was sold to Alexander Armstrong, also of Albany. It was subsequently sold to the Alexander Armstrongs (Sr and Jr) and George Waters, as joint owners. When Armstrong (Sr) died on 21 October 1901 his son and Waters became joint owners. In 1918 the vessel was valued at £2 500 although insured for only£1 500. At this time the master was G. Robeson.
THE LOSS
The Bruce was moored alongside the hulk Margaret at the Town Jetty when soon after 8.00 p.m. the tug caught fire. The alarm was raised, but it was nearly half an hour before the fire brigade reached the scene. Flames burned through the mooring lines and the tug drifted out from the jetty, making the firemen’s efforts fruitless as the hoses could not reach the burning vessel. The tug Awhina stood by to prevent The Bruce from drifting and doing damage to other vessels. Eventually the still burning vessel was towed to the shallow water on the east side of the municipal baths, ‘and there at 10 o’clock she was still a ball of fire, although all fittings above the water-line had disappeared’ (Albany Advertiser, 20 March 1918: 3b).
SITE LOCATION
What little remains of The Bruce is buried under reclaimed land now covered by modern port developments.
INITIAL SALVAGE
N. Pannet stated in 1991 that his father had demolished The Bruce using explosives in order to recover brass fittings. Much of the resultant debris was then taken away from the site. The boiler and funnel from The Bruce were recovered and used on the steamer Silver Star. The engine appears to have been left on the beach, but the propeller was salvaged and later sold.","NO","NSW","4","","","2.56","2-cylinder compound steam engine, 25 NHP & 250 IHP","195/72","N","N","","","22.86","","","","","106158","Sydney, Berry's Bay","Albany","Fremantle","Albany","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

"Thetis","1846/07/29","Torbay","","","G.V. Marten","","N","3.40","","Whale oil","","  Thetis was built for Messrs Morton and Gray at Fremantle and launched on 24 April 1845. It had one deck, a square stern, a scroll head, and was described in a newspaper as ‘a pretty little vessel, and has more the appearance of a yacht than a profitable trading craft’ (Gazette, 26 April 1845: 2c). However, Mrs Eliza Chester, who travelled as a passenger from Fremantle to Albany in 1845, considered it:
 a most miserable and wretched little boat. When lying in my bunk I could not raise my head, for if I did I would bump it. I slept on one side of the boat, my mother in the centre and my two sisters on the other side. The ship was not lined. We came down to our bunks through a hole about two feet across. There was no ladder, but hanging down from the centre of the roof was a horrible old rusty chain, the end of which lay in coils on the bottom of the boat in bilge water. Outside the hole on the deck was an iron grid they used to boil the kettle on (Western Mail, 27 January 1927: 16c).
Many of the schooner’s early voyages were under the command of Thomas Morton, a part-owner. As Morton and Gray were involved in whaling at Torbay, the schooner’s cargo was very often related to this trade. For instance when it arrived at Fremantle on 3 February 1847 from King George Sound via the various south-west ports the cargo included 18 casks of oil and five bundles of whalebone.
In July 1846 it was stranded at Torbay, but soon got off. In May 1847 it was sold to the Pelsart Fishing Company for £164. On 30 March 1848 that company sold the Thetis to Patrick Marmion for £97 10s 0d, and this was the first voyage under his ownership.
The Thetis was under the command of Thomas Frederick Flanders Gilman with a crew of two. On the voyage to Augusta the small schooner had sprung its mainmast As a consequence it had called at Castle Rock where a new mast of ‘blue-gum’ (Inquirer, 17 May 1848: 2b) was made, fitted and rigged, the Thetis departing there on 5 May to continue the voyage.
THE LOSS
After landing some cargo for James Turner at Augusta the Thetis set course for Bunbury. However, strong westerly winds prevented it from rounding Cape Leeuwin, so the schooner was turned to run eastward and sought shelter near Black Point. Here the vessel anchored in a small bay near the point. Because the swell produced by the gale threatened to overwhelm the anchored Thetis the cables were slipped, and the schooner deliberately beached to prevent it foundering. Using a rope swum ashore by the two crewmen, Gilman reached the shore safely, and they then walked back to Augusta. The schooner went to pieces on the rocks.
INITIAL SALVAGE
On the arrival of the crew of the Thetis at Augusta the Turners went to the site of the wreck with their bullocks and horses to salvage what they could, but found that the wreck had completely broken up. Some of the cargo was saved, all of it damaged to some extent.

THE VESSEL
The Thistle was built by L. Durante in Italy as the barque Giovanni Batta Repetto, more commanly referred to as Gio. Batta Repetto. It had one deck, a round stern and a figurehead, and cost £22?000 to build. The framing was of Italian oak with planking of pitch pine. On 10 March 1899, while leaving Albany, the barque struck a reef, believed to be Michaelmas Reef. Badly damaged, it was towed back to Albany harbour where the cargo was discharged, but after examination and despite temporary repairs by a diver, it was condemned as a wreck.
The wreck was bought by John Bateman of the firm of J. & W. Bateman for £300. Fremantle shipwright Robert Howson was employed by Bateman to heave the vessel down and repair the badly damaged planking, including sheathing it with felt and yellow metal The repaired barque sailed for Fremantle on 3 September, arriving six days later having cost Bateman a total of only £1?800. On 8 November 1899 at Fremantle it was registered as the Thistle, No. 8 of 1899 (McKenna, 1959) or No. 2 of 1899 (Dickson, 1996). The official number was changed to 102225, with John Bateman owning all 64 shares. Its first voyage under the new registration was to Shanghai on 29 November 1899.
THE LOSS
The Thistle departed Bunbury for Durban, South Africa, on 9 May 1903 and was not heard of again. On board were the master, O. Williams, 15 crewmen and one passenger. The vessel’s value was £3 000 and the cargo of jarrah was valued at £4 500. Its disappearance remains a mystery. Some large timbers found in deep water by a fisherman may be associated with the disappearance of the Thistle.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
TECHNICAL (2)
The Thistle is technically significant as a large vessel which was wrecked and written off, but subsequently salvaged and repaired before being put back into overseas service.
RARE (7)
The Thistle is rare in being the only Italian-built vessel lost from a south-west port.

"Toba","15/12/1933","Peak Islet, Hamelin Bay","","1917: Clark & Co. 1933: Hagbarth ‘Albert’ Hansen","Martinsen","","Y","3.90","120.00","fish","1472"," Toba was built by the Celebes Trading Company at the Aru Islands in the eastern part of what is now Indonesia, for Clark & Co. It had one deck, a straight stem and a counter stern. The joint owners of the vessel, and partners in the company, were James V. Clark, Robert Philp, Percival Pitman Outridge, Isabella Mitchell Campbell, all of Queensland, and one Western Australian, James Theodore Clewett McKenzie, from Broome. Clark & Co. owned over 200 schooners and luggers, most based at Thursday Island, but also some based at Dobo in the Aru Islands. It had been trying to gain entry to the Western Australian pearling industry for many years, a move resisted strongly by the Master Pearlers Association of Broome. However in 1916 Clark was given permission to bring 34 of his boats to Broome. Toba was one of these, and was registered at Fremantle as No. 4/1917 on 26 January 1917. Campbell died on 24 February 1918 but the remaining four partners retained joint ownership. When Philp died on 17 June 1922 the surviving three still remained joint owners. During 1930 the ketch was sold to Hagbarth ‘Albert’ Hansen. The registry was closed on 30 October 1930, and Toba was then re-registered by Hansen as a Geraldton fishing boat, with the registration number G29. It was locally known as ‘Number 29’.
Hansen, aged 34, lived in Marble Bar, and had purchased the Toba for use in the fishing industry, basing the vessel mainly in Fremantle. The four crewmen on this trip were named Martinsen (skipper), Hansen (almost certainly a brother of the owner), Landhurst and Jarlburg. They had been fishing in the Albany area, and had been away from Fremantle for about two weeks before returning to that port with a cargo of fish.
THE LOSS
A newspaper reported that the Toba had run ashore on Hamelin Island at about 8.00 p.m. on 15 December 1933, and had sunk in 20 ft (6.1 m) of water (West Australian 18 December 1933: 19c). This report appears to be in error as the wreck of the Toba lies very close to Peak Island, where it had presumably struck. The four men were picked up by a small fishing boat from Bunbury which landed them on the mainland at Hamelin Bay. A group settler named Jock O’Kane cared for them at Karridale until the lighthouse keeper at Cape Leeuwin took them to Perth by car on 20 December.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The crew of the Toba lost everything when the vessel went down, including the fish caught over the previous two weeks.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Toba lies only 10 m south of Peak Island, hard up against the sloping reef in 7.6 m of water.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck of the Toba was inspected by Michael McCarthy (Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum), on 2 February 1980. The wreckage is on an axis of 120º and lies down the slope of the reef. There is some timber, consisting of a few frames, planking and ceiling with a total thickness of 15 cm, together with ballast stones, a windlass and some 10 mm diameter fastenings. The windlass is a metre long by 0.8 m in diameter.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
During the 1960s a small compass bowl supported by three stylised dolphins was recovered from the site of the wreck of the Toba, along with some rubber diver’s hose, the latter recovered by E. Christiansen in 1965. A compass of a similar unusual design, but bigger, was recovered from the wreck of the Katinka, also lost in Hamelin Bay, and both are now on display at the Augusta Historical Museum. The rudder from the Toba is also on display at this museum.","NO","Indonesia","4","27791","","1.97","N","2009/0205/SG _MA-63/08","Y","Y","-34.216667","","12.20","","115.021255","","7.60","131662","Aru Islands Dutch East Indies","Albany","Fremantle","Fremantle","Chart","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

"Topgallant","1933/11/10","Koombana Bay","","","","Caught fire outside Bunbury, towed inside and beached, but destroyed","N","","","","1034","  Topgallant was a fishing boat, and was owned by a man named Vines from Busselton. The ketch had previously been owned by Dr Kennedy of Perth, was well fitted, and worth an estimated £1 500. The vessel was equipped with refrigeration, and was at the time of its loss manned by only one person, the son of the owner.
THE LOSS
The Topgallant left Bunbury Harbour on Friday 10 November, but being unable to make headway against the strong winds it began to put back. About 3.00 p.m. a fire started on board, and E. Robertson went in his boat to attempt to tow the ketch in to harbour. However the engine on his boat was not powerful enough for the task, so he abandoned the tow and brought Vines ashore. The Echo under the command of Patrick Lyons then towed the Topgallant from about 400 m offshore into the shelter provided by the Bunbury Harbour breakwater. Here the ketch was beached, and although the Bunbury pilot attended, nothing could be done to extinguish the flames and it burnt to the waterline.","NO","","","","","","N","405/71","N","N","","","12.80","","","","","","","","","","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., 2012.

"Trial","1622/05/24","Trial Rocks","","English East India Company","John Brookes","","Y","","","General","AUS 747","A  British East Indiaman of approximately 500 tons, under the command of John Brooke  wrecked on the Tryal Rocks off the north-west coast of Western Australia in 1622. It is Australia's oldest known shipwreck. Departed Plymouth on maiden voyage for Batavia (now Jakarta). Stopped at Cape Town  learned of new Brouwer route to the Indies. On the night of  25 May 1622  with 143 on board struck  the reef now reef  named Tryal Rocks.
 Brooke, son John and nine others boarded  a skiff and Thomas Bright and 35 others a longboat, sailing for Batavia separately.  93 sailors were lost and one died in the skiff. Brookes subsequently falsified his position, resulting in great confusion as to the exact position of the reef. After examining the records and Bright's letter countering Brookes falsehoods in 1934 historian Ida Lee proved that what was then known as Ritchie’s Reef was the site and the reef renamed. In 1969 the wreck was located after researchers John MacPherson and Eric Christiansen of the Fremantle-based Underwater Explorer's Club determined the position after examining Lee's research and the contemporary records.   Members of the team to locate the site were Christiansen (leader), Naiom Haimson, Dave Nelley and Ellis Alfred (Alan) Robinson. Chris Muhlmann was skipper.
Shortly after the discovery, Robinson attempted an illegal salvage operation through the use of explosives and badly damaged the wreck site.
Sponsored by M.G. Kailis of Gulf Fisheries, led by Jeremy Green divers from the Western Australian Museum followed up on an earlier Museum expedition under Harry Bingham and  in 1971 conducted a detailed examination of the wreck site. While six cannon, and up to eight anchors of a type expected from the period and some small objects were recorded, no artefacts were found that allowed a positive identification of the site. As a result,  Green concluded that the wreck was most likely the Tryall.  The Museum's display in the Shipwreck Galleries at Fremantle houses a small number recovered items including a large iron cannon that was recovered on a later Museum expedition under Green’s leadership.","NO","UK","139","1996/10","93","","N","2009/0206/SG _MA-830/71","Y","Y","-20.2859833333","","","","115.3752333333","","","","","Plymouth","Plymouth","Batavia","GPS","Protected Federal","Green, J.

"Twilight","1877/05/24","Twilight Cove","","George Thomson, of Fremantle","","Driven ashore in gale","Y","4.27","","Telegraph stores","BA 1056","  Twilight was launched in February 1869 with one deck and a square stern. The original owners were John Chester (32 shares), Edward Newman and William Bartram (joint owners of 24 shares), and Barrington Clark Wood (8 shares). When Newman died on 25 November 1872 his widow, Ellen Newman, and Wood were granted probate as executors. This also happened when Bartram died on 23 May 1874. In June 1874 Chester sold his half share in the cutter to Joshua James Harwood, and Wood sold his eight shares to Lionel Gould. At the same time Gould also bought the 24 shares from the executors of the estates of Newman and Bartram. In January 1876 Harwood became sole owner when he bought Gould’s 32 shares. However only eight months later Harwood sold 32 shares each to George Thompson and James George Flindell, Thompson selling half of his shares to Abraham Moses Josephson five days later. The owners at the time it was wrecked were therefore George Thompson (16 shares), George Flindell (32 shares) and Abraham Josephson (16 shares).
On 10 March 1872 the Twilight was anchored in Koombana Bay when an exceptionally violent gale blew the cutter over the bar of the Leschenault Inlet. It lost its rudder in the process, was subsequently repaired, and in May 1877 was anchored in Twilight Cove discharging a cargo of wire and insulators for the overland telegraph line. Also anchored and discharging a similar cargo was the cutter Cartabunup/Bunyip (see entry). Both these vessels had been chartered by Mr Gilham.
THE LOSS
About midnight on 24 May 1877 the Twilight under the command of Captain Joe Tager was driven ashore in a severe gale, becoming a total wreck. The crew got ashore safely, but the cargo was described as being ‘buried in the sand, from which it would be impossible to extract…(Sydney Morning Herald, 30 June 1877: 5b). The quantity of material on the two vessels was said to be sufficient for 100 miles (160 km) of telegraph line, and that because of the loss the work would be delayed by six weeks. The crew walked overland to the Israelite Bay telegraph station, a distance of about 275 km to report their loss.
INITIAL SALVAGE
As stated above the newspaper reported that the cargo was considered impossible to recover, and there is no mention of any subsequent salvage of the vessel.
SITE LOCATION
Due to coastline accretion the site of the wreck of the Twilight is now buried under sand some distance inland. It is reported as being buried under a sand hummock 600 m east of the wreck of the Swift (see entry). During a wreck inspection of the Swift in May 1977 by Scott Sledge of the Western Australian Museum, an unsuccessful search was conducted in an attempt to locate the wreck of the Twilight.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
Around 1900 Mr Dunn broke up part of the wreck of the Twilight to obtain timber to line a well some 3.7 m deep. This fresh water well is said to be in the same sand hills as the wreck of the Twilight, but closer to the sea shore.

The hull was copper sheathed. Benedict Von Bibra, shipbuilder of Subpore Howrath, Calcutta, initially owned it but J. & W. Bateman of Fremantle purchased the vessel in March 1868 for £1 000. Von Bibra’s occupation was also termed as a ship’s havildar. It was used in the coastal trade between Fremantle and Champion Bay, with occasional longer voyages. This vessel was wrecked on the west coast of Garden Island on 30 January 1873 on a voyage from Champion Bay to Fremantle.
THE STRANDING
While anchored at Port Irwin a strong westerly gale blew the Twinkling Star ashore. It was refloated and continued its coastal passages for a further four and a half years. It was later lost at Garden Island, but to date the wreck has not been found.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE

The whale-boats used by George Grey during his expedition to explore the Western Australian coast in February 1839 were typical of those found in many places around the world. The drawing ‘Attack of Natives Near Kolaina Plains. Drawn on stone by Geo. Barnard from a Sketch by Fredk. C. Smith Esq’ Shows one of Grey’s boats on the beach (Grey, 1983 [1839]: 377).
Whale-boats were lightly built of 13 mm planking (cedar in the case of most American-built boats). Weighing about 900–1 000 lb (400–450 kg), they were capable of carrying 1?000 lb (450 kg) of stores plus a normal crew of six men, one steering and five rowing. They were cheap and quick to build and, when used by whaling vessels, were not expected to have a long life. Repairs were often carried out aboard ship, but just as often the boats would be abandoned as too badly damaged, or perhaps sold locally before the whaler headed home at the end of the voyage. Whale-boats were seaworthy, manoeuvrable and capable of withstanding hard usage. The whale-boats from the Nantucket whaler Essex that was sunk by a whale in 1820 were sailed and rowed over 3?700 km in the eastern Pacific Ocean before the crew were rescued.
From Willits Ansel comes the following description:
The boats used in sperm whaling in the 1830s and 1840s were light, shallow, lapstrake, double-ended boats with strong sheer and raking ends. Forward they had bow chocks, warp box, and thigh board with clumsy cleat. There were five thwarts for the men pulling the long, single banked oars, three on the starboard and two on the port side. Aft was the cuddy board and loggerhead, which tended to rake aft in earlier boats. The steering oar was on the port side of the stern post (Ansell, 1983: 14).
THE LOSS
George Grey had left Fremantle on 17 February 1839 aboard the American whaler Russell, (302 tons, Captain George B. Long) of New Bedford, to continue his exploration of the Western Australian coast. He had procured three whale-boats for this task. Grey and his party of 11 together with their boats, food and other supplies, were disembarked on Bernier Island on 25 February. Two days later he lost his first boat, named the Paul Pry, when a storm arose and it was washed side on to the beach and broken up by the surf. Grey also lost half a ton of stores that were in the boat. More importantly he also lost most of the cache of stores he had previously buried on Bernier Island.
After some exploration of the coast and islands the party departed Shark Bay through South Passage, arriving at the northern extremity of Ganthaume Bay at 10 a.m. on 31 March 1839. They sailed the two boats the length of the bay searching for a suitable landing place where fresh water might be obtained. A site was chosen and, with Grey at the steering oar, the first boat attempted a landing through the heavy surf. The boat landed on rocks that had unfortunately not been seen from seaward, and was badly damaged. Grey and his boat crew endeavoured to get their damaged boat and its stores ashore as quickly as possible. The crew of the second boat had not seen the accident because high waves shut out their view. Seeing Grey’s men haul the whale-boat ashore, they presumed that conditions were suitable for landing. Consequently they also attempted to land but at a site slightly further south. Grey tried to warn the crew of the other boat but was unsuccessful. The second boat was also damaged when it struck the shore, some planks being split for their full length.
The expedition carpenters could not repair either boat, but even had this been possible Grey had decided to abandon them as he considered it would be impossible to launch them through the heavy surf. There was no alternative but to begin the long trek to Perth.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Grey and his party salvaged little in the way of supplies, 20 lb (9 kg) of damaged flour and one pound (0.45 kg) of salt pork per man being all they could save.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
Discoveries in 1995 and 2005 of artefacts in the sand-hill at the back of the beach between the Blue Hole and the Kalbarri townsite are probably associated with the loss of Grey’s whale-boats. In 1995 lead shot weighing 1415.5?g was discovered, and in 2005 the Museum recovered a further 74.2 g of lead shot and a lead artefact covered in iron rust and weighing 10.5 kg at the same site. The lead shot was of two sizes, the larger averaging 10 mm in diameter and the smaller averaging 7 mm in diameter. On some there was evidence of having been in a mould while some have sprues. Two sites containing bones were also located nearby.
Because of the position of these discoveries close to the beach where Grey’s whale-boats are thought to have come ashore, it is probable that the artefacts will prove to be associated with his expedition. However at this stage there is no direct evidence of a link.","NO","","12","2005/10/16","","","","MA3405","Y","Y","-27.727937","","8.59","","114.153127","","","","","Shark Bay","","Fremantle","2005GPS","Protected State","J.

It had two decks, one bulkhead, a forecastle 10.3 m long and a poop 11.6 m in length, and was cemented. There are differing opinions as to the rig with Lubbock (1966: 76) stating that it was a full-rigged ship while Cairns & Henderson (1995: 217) claim that it was rigged as a schooner. Lloyd’s Register has it listed as an iron ship. According to Lubbock the vessel carried single topgallant sails, and the main yard was 91 ft (27.7 m) long. The ship was capable of making fast passages. For example in 1891 the voyage from Maryport, on the Solway Firth in England, to Sydney had only taken 88½ days, the best day’s run being 280 miles (518 km).
 proceeded to Fremantle under the temporary command of Captain Abbott, as Captain Carrey had lost his certificate of competency at the Court of Inquir afte r grounding the ship  at  Bunbury.
After taking on sand ballast at Garden Island the Ulidia was to have been sailed to Newcastle, NSW, by Captain J. McAdam, sent by the owners to Fremantle to take command. On 18 May 1893 when sailing out of Fremantle without a pilot the Ulidia was wrecked near the Straggler Reef.
INQUIRY
Captain Lawrie and Captain Shaw (in charge of the lighters) held a survey of the Ulidia at Bunbury, finding little damage above the waterline. They ordered a diver to be sent down to examine the underwater hull.
The ship’s agents, Mr King from Fremantle and Thomas Hayward from Bunbury, made enquiries into the conduct of Captain Carey, resulting in them dismissing him from the ship on the morning of 15 February.
The following day a Court of Inquiry consisting of Resident Magistrate W.H. Timperley, W. Spencer, J.P. and Captain Owston was held at the Magistrate’s Court in Bunbury where the following charges were heard:
1. That he did carelessly navigate the ship Ulidia.
2. That on the 14th inst. he was intoxicated.
3. That he allowed 10 able seamen to desert the ship.
4. That he was again intoxicated on the 15th.
5. That he neglected to make entries in the official log book (Bunbury Herald, 1 March 1893: 3c).
Captain Carey admitted to being drunk on the two occasions. These were the actions which resulted in his dismissal from the ship. He was found guilty of the first four charges and the court suspended his certificate of competency for 12 months.","NO","Scotland","","1996","","7.40","N","2009/0207/SG _MA-187/76","Y","Y","-32.0576666667","","91.40","","115.6288333333","","","76257","Stockton on Tees, Durham","Garden Island","Belfast","Newcastle, New South Wales","GPS","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J. with Green, J., (2012).

15th December 1873
Warder Feltham, Canning River Party.
Memorandum.
In reference to the work to be done in clearing out the canals, repairing the
wattle fencing, and deepening the various channels on the Canning River,
the following instructions are forwarded for Warder Feltham's guidance.
The entrance to the first canal from Mason's landing requires deepening,
the silt in all cases to be put on the shore side of the fencing, and not left on
the canal side; if possible, after the deepening has been done, the fence is to
be carried on from the bed of shells on the right side ascending the river to
the tuft of rushes near the entrance to the Blind Creek. Also remove all the
hummocks in the passage down the stream, and all the snags wherever they in
any way impede the navigation, particularly at the spot where the boats were
struck on Friday last. Also, deepen down to where the old flat is sunk, and
renew the cross wattling near this spot, some of the fencing is also gone here
and requires renewing. Deepen the sand bank between the two lines of fencing

In tow of the river steamer Emerald, the hulks of a dredge, and a whaling vessel were taken to the marine graveyard off Rottnest Island yesterday, and scuttled in deep water. The dredge was originally used in connection with the construction of a naval base south of Fremantle. and, together with two tugs, was purchased by A. E. Tilley and Co. who converted one of the tugs into the Emerald. The other tug was driven ashore near the abandoned naval base. Negotiations for the sale of the dredge, to a buyer in New Zealand fell through, and the old vessel was stripped of everything of value by Mr. J. Hall, who ultimately became the owner of the dredge the second tug.","","","","","1584","","","","Shipwreck","Metro (Graveyard)"

It crashed into the sea about 10 miles from Broome (Map Reference 17.50 - 122.08), about 7 miles off Cable Beach. It was carrying 33 wounded from Java which included twenty USAAF personnel, 19 of whom did not survive the crash. Lt. William E. Ragsdale was the co-pilot of ""Arabian Nights"". They were on their way to Perth. Another source shows this B-24 as #74.
The aircraft broke in half. At least two personnel survived the initial crash. They were Staff Sergeant Melvin Donoho and Staff Sergeant Willard J. Beatty. They stayed together and swam towards the shore. They started swimming at about 10 am that day and were still together later the next afternoon. They somehow became separated and Donoho made it shore and struggled to the airfield where he was found naked, sunburnt and severely exhausted.
Staff Sergeant Beatty, in a very bad state, was found on the beach by a shore patrol. He was rushed to Perth but died. For some strange reason, his body cannot be accounted for.

Captain John Thomas built the Venus as a cutter in 1839. Built of jarrah it was coppered three years later, and lengthened and re-rigged as a schooner in August 1850, just prior to its last voyage north. There is a sail plan of a cutter that has been passed down through the Thomas family and it has been conjectured that this is a plan of the Venus. The plan shows a vessel about 35 ft (10.7 m) in length.
The Venus traded to the eastern colonies of Australia, Mauritius and Asian ports such as Singapore. In September 1842 it had been blown ashore in gale but was got off undamaged. It was returning from Singapore, having delivered a cargo of 20 tons of sandalwood, with part of the return cargo consisting of the overland mail from Europe.
THE LOSS
The Venus, under the command of Captain Mason, with four crew and a passenger, struck one of the reefs on the Pelsaert Group of the Houtman Abrolhos at 11 p.m. on 10 April 1851. The passage from Singapore had taken over ten weeks and there had been insufficient water aboard, so the crew were in a very poor state of health. The survivors lived on Middle Island, where there was one of the few more or less permanent water supplies in the Houtman Abrolhos. This reliable source of water had been well known since the Beagle voyage of 1840. As the Venus had visited the Abrolhos previously during its involvement with the Pelsart Fishing Company, the crew would have been well aware of the availability of water there. One seaman, John Williams, the cook, remained on the wreck as he was too weak to move. He was visited three times by the other survivors, five days, twelve days and fifteen days after the vessel went ashore. He was found dead on their last visit, and was buried on Middle Island. The crew of the Venus lived on seals, shellfish and some rice and sugar retrieved from the wreck.
After living on Middle Island for six months, on 15 October 1851 Captain Mason, a crewman and the passenger sailed for Champion Bay in a small dinghy, on which they had constructed a deck and rigged a mast and sails. They arrived at Champion Bay that same day and delivered the mail. A week later the Resident Magistrate at Champion Bay, William Burges, directed George Green of the schooner Evergreen to rescue the remaining two sailors from Middle Island. Green was paid £20 for this task.
SITE LOCATION
Some mid-19th nails found near Gun Island could point to the site of the wreck of the Venus.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
SOCIAL (3)
Captain John Thomas arrived in Western Australia as a child when his parents came from Wales as part of Thomas Peel’s entourage. John Thomas’ father and brother, James, were convicted of plundering cargo from the wreck of the Cumberland in 1834. As a result all the Thomas possessions including their boats were confiscated. John successfully petitioned the Colonial Secretary for the return of the small fishing boat Jane in order that the family would not be left destitute. By 1841 John had built the Venus (21 tons) with which, despite its small size, he began trading to the eastern colonies, Mauritius and Asia. Five years later he had the Empress (50 tons) built by David Jones. This vessel was used on the Asia run until 1858 when Thomas sold it at Singapore and purchased the barque Rory O’More (296 tons). Captain John Thomas is an example of the rise of a successful fisherman/ boat builder/ shipowner of the mid-19th century.
He served five terms as chairman of the Fremantle Town Trust. He also owned and ran hotels in Fremantle and Ravenswood.
The Deputy Surveyor General, John Forrest, visited the Pelsaert Group in 1879, and recorded a grave on Middle Island. The headstone had the following inscription:
Here lieth the body of John Williams Seaman, died April 1851 in the wreck of the Venus aged 41 years.
There is evidence that Williams may have been a Negro who left an American whaler in Fremantle, married and then worked as crew on the Venus. This would account for the recording of a skeleton excavated in1978 as not being that of a European.
REPRESENTATIVE (8)
The Venus is representative of the small vessels that carried a wide variety of cargoes from Western Australia to various Indian Ocean ports and the eastern colonies.

"Venus","14/08/1923","50 miles north of Fremantle, Cape Leschenault","Robert Howson, Claremont","F.J., H.J., and F. A. Ball, according to British Mercantile Navy List 1917: The West Australian Goverment, Fremantle","F.J. Ball","Blown ashore during heavy weather","Y","5.74","","","","  Venus was a single screw steamer built in Fremantle by Robert Howson in 1897. Howson was born in Sunderland, England, and worked his passage to Fremantle in 1875 as a boatswain on board the Spinaway, one of the J. & W. Bateman vessels. John Bateman had arranged Howson’s travel to Western Australia so that the shipwright could build vessels for him under contract. The Venus was carvel built with a straight stem and counter stern. The engine was a 2-cylinder compound steam engine producing 15 NHP or 45 IHP, built by G. Eldridge of London in 1895 giving a speed of 8 knots. There was one steel boiler operating at 120 lb per square inch pressure, also built by Eldridge in 1895. The vessel had auxiliary sails and was described in a newspaper as a ‘steam-sailer’ (The West Australian (WA), 22 August 1923: 9g). The Venus was built for the Venus Steamship Company Limited of Fremantle and despite owning it since launching in 1897 they only registered the vessel on 9 May 1906.
The Venus Steamship Co. Ltd sold the Venus to William Bower Fallowfield, a guano merchant of Geraldton, in January 1908 and he in turn sold it to the Western Australian Government in July 1909. The Government sold the Venus to a consortium consisting of James Ball, Henry James Ball and Francis Andrew Ball, general lightermen and contractors of North Fremantle, in July 1919 for £755.
The Venus was damaged on 20 September 1906 (Dickson, 1992) in an incident with the unregistered steam launch Brownie. McKenna (1959) states the Brownie was a lugger and the master was William Luly. On 17 October 1920 the Venus’ seacocks were opened in what appears to have been an act of sabotage. It filled and sank but was subsequently raised.
THE LOSS
The Venus left Fremantle at 9.00 a.m. on 13 August 1923, calling in at Rottnest Island to pick up two crewmen, one of whom was Manuel Colleli, the caretaker of Government House on the island. The crew were Francis Ball, skipper, Henry James Ball, engineer, T. Hopkins, fireman, J. Malone, son-in-law of James Ball, Manuel Colleli and ‘Charlie’ Anderson, a Norwegian. It sailed from there on 14 August heading for the Abrolhos on a lobster fishing venture.
About nightfall, when near the Moore River, it began to blow heavily. At 9.00 p.m. the full force of the wind and waves struck the vessel broadside on, the impact of the first huge wave tearing the steam pipe from the boiler and so rendering the engine useless. The wind forced the steamer towards a reef about three miles from the coast. Just before it struck, another large wave lifted it over the reef. As the vessel cleared the reef ‘Charlie’ Anderson was washed overboard. Three more huge waves struck the Venus in quick succession, the last of these carrying Henry Ball overboard. The other four men managed to stay with the vessel until it hit the beach in the early hours of the morning. They waded ashore and the two youngest, Francis Ball and Manuel Colleli, walked inland to seek assistance. After walking about 13 km they reached the farm of W.R. McCormick at Gingin Brook.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The only known items recovered were a lifebuoy and a lifebelt discovered on the beach about 13?km north of the wreck by Constable Trecardo of Moore River during his search for the two men who had been washed overboard.
SITE LOCATION
Nine kilometres south of Ledge Point town. The boiler partly shows above water about 8 m offshore at low tide.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The axis of the wreck is almost bow on to the beach. The overall length of wreckage visible is 16.8 m but the boiler appears to be one of the few artefacts always visible. Due to constant filling then scouring of the sand overburden the remainder of the wreckage is occasionally visible. The propeller shaft bearing is about 25?m offshore along the apparent line of the keel. Some frames and hull planking remain along with a few other artefacts.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
The ship’s wheel off the Venus has been recovered and conserved by the Department of Materials Conservation of the Western Australian Museum.

On 28 April 1656 the Vergulde Draeck was wrecked just south of Ledge Point. 75 of the 193 made it to shore. A small boat was sent with the Understeersman and six others to Batavia (now Jakarta) arriving 40 days later. There they reported that as they sailed away they saw the other survivors trying to refloat a larger boat that had capsized in the surf while landing. Two vessels were sent south in search, but failed in difficult conditions to sight either the wreckage or the survivors. Eleven men and a boat were also lost during the search. In January 1658 two other ships were sent out in search but also proved unsuccessful. In searching for survivors, the jacht Goede Hoop and the Waeckende Boei lost boats and 10 men. A boat commanded by Abraham Leeman also disappeared, but it successfully returned to Batavia, arriving nearly six months after having been given up as lost. The wreck, the first of the Dutch and English East India ships found on the Western Australian coast, was discovered by five spear-fishermen (John Cowen; Jim, Alan and Graeme Henderson; and Alan Robinson ) in April 1963. After a period in which both it and the Batavia, (which was found later in the same year) were heavily looted shipwreck legislation was enacted, vesting the sites in the Western Australian Museum. Subsequently the remains were excavated by Jeremy Green and a report was published.

"Victory","1875/06/28","West Cape Howe","","Captain William Douglas of Albany","","Driven ashore by bad weather","N","4.27","","","AUS 118, AUS 759 & BA 1034"," Victory was built with one deck and an elliptical stern for William Douglas of Albany. It was launched in early May 1874, and registered at Fremantle (No. 11/1874). It is not known who built the cutter, but it is possible that John Odgers Peters, a boat builder at Albany at that time, was responsible. Only about two weeks after launching, on 18 May, the cutter was blown ashore, but salvaged with little damage.  In June 1875 Douglas presumably had either sold the cutter or chartered it to Joshua Josiah Harwood of Fremantle as a contemporary newspaper report names him as the owner. The Victory was under the command of Captain Wood.
THE LOSS
The Victory departed Albany on Saturday 26 June 1875 for Fremantle, but later that day was driven ashore and wrecked by bad weather at West Cape Howe. The crew managed to lower a boat in which they made it safely to the shore near Torbay. They arrived at Albany three days later having saved only the clothes they were wearing. The steamer Georgette reported that it had experienced a strong gale and heavy seas at around the same time while east of Cape Leeuwin en route from Albany to Fremantle.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
HISTORIC (1)
The Victory was the earliest vessel to be owned by William Douglas, the first of the well-known family involved in the maritime history of Albany.

"Villalta","1897/02/26","North of Moore River 12 miles 6.5Km","Reid and Co at Glasgow","Nicholson and McGill of Liverpool","Captain Whiting Harland","Struck reef","Y","10.00","","Timber","AUS 334"," Villalta was built of riveted steel by J. Reid & Co. of Glasgow in 1883 to Lloyd’s 100A1 under Special Survey. The vessel had two decks, one bulkhead and was cemented. It had a raised quarterdeck 10.4 m long and forecastle 7.3 m long. The owners were Nicholson & McGill of Liverpool. The Villalta left Tacoma in Puget Sound on 9 November 1896 under the command of Captain Whiting Harland with a crew of seventeen and a cargo of timber for Fremantle.
THE LOSS
In a moderate gale the Villalta was running down the coast close hauled on the starboard tack under topsails and fore and main courses. The second officer, Francis Cox, reported to the captain that there was land abeam. This was contrary to Captain Harland’s reckoning of the previous day, and he would not believe Cox. At about 12.45 a.m. while travelling at 6 knots the barque struck Leschenault Reef. With seas breaking over the vessel it very quickly became obvious to Harland that there was no chance of saving the ship.
He ordered the lifeboat lowered but the seas overturned it and all eighteen crewmen were tossed into the water. The boat was eventually righted but in the time this took, both the captain and an apprentice, William Thomas, drowned. It appears that Thomas could not swim and had lost his lifebelt, as did many others due to faulty or perished slings. Sixteen survivors reached the shore and made their way to ‘Coobarby’ Station. From here word of the wrecking was sent to Fremantle.
The Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd immediately sent their steamer Colac to the wreck site, possibly hoping for salvage opportunities as had occurred with the Europa. Although the captain boarded the wreck it was clear that there was no hope of salvaging the Villalta and little hope of salvaging the cargo. The seas had washed the deck cargo of timber and all other moveable items off the deck. The barque lay on her beam ends with the deck facing seaward, about 4 km offshore. The force of the seas eventually battered the timber cargo below deck through the steel hull of the Villalta, so that timber protruded through the plates on both sides of the vessel. It was surging about on the reef and eventually slid off and drifted to the shore some 6.4 km north of the mouth of the Moore River. The Villalta could be now boarded ‘dry-shod’ from the beach and was described as having broken in two in the region of the forward chainplates, with the foremast and mainmasts gone but the mizzen still standing. Because of the barque’s position on the shore the remaining timber cargo in the hold now appeared to be salvageable.
INQUIRY
A preliminary inquiry was held at Fremantle on 4 March 1897, as a result of which Captain Harland was held to be responsible for the wrecking because of his careless navigation. The mate claimed in evidence that a current had set the vessel off course towards the coast. No blame was attached to other officers. Captain Inglis of the Colac stated later that in his opinion the current set to seaward at this point, and so could not have caused the disaster as it would have caused the Villalta to be set further offshore, and not towards the coast. The Court’s decision to blame the wrecking on Captain Harland was received with some criticism, and there was a suggestion that the master had been found a convenient, and absent, scapegoat.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The underwriters abandoned the Villalta and it was sold to Connor & Doherty on 29 March 1897 for £80 with a further £210 for the timber cargo. They, however, subsequently sold the vessel and its cargo to James Lilly & Co. for £315. This firm salvaged much of the timber over the following months, using the steamer Beagle to take it to Fremantle.
SITE LOCATION
The wreck lies about 60 m from the shore, approximately 3 km south of Seabird and 1 km south of Cape Leschenault.
SITE DESCRIPTION
Part of the stern of the wreck of the Villalta is visible above water, and the rest lies scattered to a depth of about 4.5 m. The axis of the wreck is bow to the north-west and stern about 40º off parallel to the shore. The wreckage covers an area approximately 55 m long by 30 m wide. It includes a windlass, hull plating, steel mast, winch, rudder shaft, bitts, fairleads, bricks, a timber yard and other scattered artefacts. The keel-keelson assembly appears to be unbroken, throwing doubt on the claim that the vessel had broken in two. The cement noted in the wreck inspection reports would come from the cementing of the inside of the lower hull when built. Part of the wreck of a blue fibreglass fishing boat is superimposed on the wreck of the Villalta.","NO","Scotland","18","1996","2","6.20","N","2009/0211/SG _MA-21/80","Y","Y","-31.2984083333","","60.80","","115.4560166667","","","87862","Glasgow","Tacoma, Puget Sound, USA","Liverpool","Fremantle","Aerial GIS","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

Built by Ateliers & Chantiers de la Loire at St Nazaire in France, the Ville de Rouen had one deck, a raised quarter deck and one bulkhead. There were however two tiers of deck beams. The vessel was one of the French Bounty ships (see Glossary), and was owned in Rouen by A. Prentout-Leblond and E. Boniface. The barque had sailed from Cardiff on 25 July 1901, under the command of E. Barthelweld, with a crew of seventeen and a cargo of 1?247 tonnes of coke, 50.8 tonnes of pig iron and 25?000 firebricks for the Fremantle Smelting Works. Also on board were 1?600 bottles of wine. The total value of the ship and cargo was £10?000.
THE LOSS
The Ville de Rouen struck the reef that now bears its name some 4.8 km off the mouth of the Moore River. Visibility was restricted at the time, due to bright moonlight being reflected off a heavy mist. The crew made it ashore soon after the vessel first struck, taking with them some ship’s gear, food and, by some accounts, a quantity of the wine cargo.
Bill Fraser, a fisherman on the Swan anchored near the mouth of the river, observed the wrecking. He twice sailed near the Ville de Rouen to offer assistance, but these offers were refused on the grounds that the crew of the barque could look after themselves. Fraser did not raise the alarm until the following day when he reported the stranding to the Rottnest Island lighthouse keeper. The government steamer Penguin, Captain Morrison, was then sent from Fremantle to investigate and en route picked up the barque’s boat in which the mate and four crewmen were making for Fremantle. On arriving at the wreck they found the barque pounding on the reef with 2.54 m of water in the hold. As the breeze freshened the Ville de Rouen began to drift, and finally came to rest with decks awash in 7.2 m of water near the southern end of the reef.
At first the crew of the Ville de Rouen refused to go to Fremantle on the Penguin, but finally Morrison threatened to leave them. They then reluctantly went on board, leaving the mate and one crewman behind to take care of the gear taken ashore. These two men were later ordered to proceed to Fremantle to join their shipmates. Early the next month the master and all of the crew of Ville de Rouen returned from Fremantle to France.

According to a newspaper account at the time, the crew of the Ville de Rouen were on the shore with ‘most of the ship’s gear and a quantity of food’. Because of the distance from Fremantle, the cargo was not considered of enough value to warrant salvaging.
SITE LOCATION
4.8 km from the Moore River on the Ville de Rouen Reefs. The bearing from the Moore River to the wreck site is 262º.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The site of the Ville de Rouen is within the reef at a depth of 7–9 m. The wreckage lies oriented on a SW–NE axis. The hull has collapsed with the topsides still visible, together with masts and spars lying just to the south and near the stern. There are also a stockless anchor, anchor chain, a donkey boiler, a two-cylinder steam winch and a number of other artefacts on site. A quantity of firebricks concreted together can also be seen.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
A stockless anchor off the Ville de Rouen was recovered by local divers and is on display at the Guilderton Country Club. The ship’s bell was at the Methodist Children’s Home in East Victoria Park but disappeared about ten years ago. Divers have removed a number of artefacts over the years including bricks, lumps of coke, a pulley sheave and other items. During a wreck inspection the Maritime Museum team recovered a brick, a piece of coke and some rope.

"Waratah","1934/04/06","Near Nornalup","","","","","N","3.35","","","1034","  Waratah was built by Edwin A. Jack of Launceston, Tasmania, of tallow wood (Eucalyptus microcorys) and kauri (Agathis australis) as a steam launch fitted with a two cylinder compound steam engine of 5 NHP. On 15 January 1897 it was sold to the Western Australian Government for the Fisheries Department. It changed hands again in 1906, becoming the property of the Police Department. In 1909 the schooner was used (unsuccessfully because it was too big) as a pilot boat at Albany. It was later sold to the owners of a shell grit mill on the Kalgan River, and used to carry their product to Albany. On the closure of the mill the Waratah was abandoned in the Kalgan River for years.
The Waratah was subsequently sold by the Jermyn brothers to Frederick Everett and Jim Bone. The new owners replaced the old 2-cylinder steam engine with a 4-cylinder petrol engine, and had it re-rigged as a schooner by Captain Farley and Lionel Austin. The engine was said to be from a truck, and very unreliable. It was rumoured (a rumour not denied) that the two were ‘going off in search of adventure’ (Albany Advertiser, 29 March 1934: 7c). The schooner was being sailed to Fremantle by Everett and Captain Downie, as Bone was still employed at the Yearlering Co-operative. At Fremantle it was intended to slip the boat and carry out an extensive overhaul together with some modifications.
The Waratah does not appear to have been registered. It departed Albany on 25 March but Captain Downie found that there was insufficient ballast and returned to port, where two tons or more of extra ballast was added.
THE LOSS
After adding the extra ballast Waratah left Albany for Fremantle in early April. On 6 April in order to avoid some bad weather the schooner put into Nornalup Inlet. ‘She anchored, but the rope parted and her rudder broke, and her career ended on a reef’ (Albany Advertiser, 9 April 1934: 1e). Both Everett and Downie got ashore safely.
INITIAL SALVAGE
The newspaper report of the incident stated that the crew had saved some of their property, but the Waratah was a total wreck.
Some of the spars of the schooner were evidently salvaged by a local man named Swarbrick, one of which he subsequently sold to the owner of a yacht which had snapped a mast.","NO","Australia","","","","1.49","4-cylinder petrol","","N","N","","","14.81","","","","","","Launceston, Tasmania","Albany","","Fremantle","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

The fishing lugger Warren was owned by Antonio Schank who sailed it with a crew of two men–Karl Rosenburg and Robert Faarenheimo. The vessel was valued at £400 and was not insured. The men were attempting to reach the shelter of Ledge Point, as bad weather was approaching.
THE LOSS
The Warren had to sail south around some dangerous reefs and then turned to head north between the reefs and the shore in order to reach the anchorage at Ledge Point. There was a very heavy sea running at the time. The vessel successfully rounded the southern end of the reef when Rosenburg, who was on look-out, saw that they were too close for safety. Schank, at the tiller, gave the order to let go the mainsail but this order was not carried out, and he could not leave the tiller to hand the sail himself. The lugger struck the reef and was holed on the port side of the bow, the rudder broken and the keel sprung. This left a 50 mm wide crack from forward near the stem to aft of the cabin. The vessel remained stranded on the reef.
An attempt was made by Rosenburg and Faarenheimo to get an anchor out over the edge of the reef to try to winch the Warren off, but the heavy seas capsized the dinghy. They disappeared for about half an hour before Schank saw them on the shore some 80 to 100 m away. The captain then gathered food and clothing onto two flat boards and swam ashore to join them, arriving about 1.00 a.m. The next morning the men returned on board to collect any remaining food. They returned to the beach and tried to signal passing ships.
They were unsuccessful in attracting attention so Rosenburg and Faarenheimo began to walk to the Moore River on 22 November. From there they sent word to Fremantle of their plight. The Fisheries Department launch Kooruldhoo (still afloat in early 2007) was dispatched to rescue Schank, who was picked up from the beach near the wreck on 27 November and taken to Fremantle.
INITIAL SALVAGE
Apart from the food and a small amount of clothing nothing was salvaged.","NO","","","","","","","","PA","","","","","","","","","","","Fremantle","","Fremantle","","Protected Federal","Worsley, P. and J., with Totty, D., 2008.

THE VESSEL
The Water Lily was built in Rutherglen, Lanarkshire, UK, by Thomas B. Seath (McKenna, 1959) or Thomas Louth (Dickson, 1996) and was clinker built having one deck and a round stern. The vessel was fitted with two sets of vertical, double acting steam engines built by A. Campbell & Sons of Glasgow of 30 NHP, in an engine room 5.5 m long. The steamer was originally registered at Liverpool and later at Manchester, UK, for use as an excursion steamer carrying up to 100 passengers.
In 1896 The Western Australian Steam Packet & Transport Company Limited purchased the Water Lily and two other vessels, the St Mawes and the Manx Fairy. In company the three steamers sailed for Fremantle. The Water Lily, rigged as a 2-masted schooner because of the small size of its coal bunkers, struck severe weather off the west coast of Africa and had to call at Bahia, Brazil, for extensive repairs. It arrived at Fremantle on 4 November 1897, over twelve months later than the Manx Fairy. The St Mawes disappeared en route and was presumed lost.
On 11 May 1898 Water Lily was sold to Zebina Lane (48 shares) and Frank Wilson (16 shares). It was first registered in Western Australia on 19 May 1898 (No. 6/1898) with Lane and Wilson shown as the owners. The steamer was then sold for £1 276 only eight days later on 27 May 1898 to the M.C. Davies’ Karri & Jarrah Timber Co. Ltd of Karridale for use as a tug, and was used in this capacity at both Hamelin and Flinders bays.
THE LOSS
The Water Lily, under the command of Donald Beaton, with a crew of able-seaman John Paddon, foundered 15 miles (27.8 km) from Bunbury on 1 February 1907 while under tow by the steam tug Vigilant from Hamelin Bay to Bunbury.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
ARCHAEOLOGICAL (4)
When found the Water Lily may yield information contributing to further knowledge of vessels which were built for a specific purpose, but during their working life were converted for a very different purpose. Water Lily was built as an excursion steamer for northern English waters, but ended up as a tug in the south-west of Western Australia.

"Wave","1848/07/05","Cheynes Beach, Cape Riche","","","","","Y","6.22","","General","BA 1034"," Wave was built in Bermuda with one deck, a square stern, billet head, no galleries and was copper sheathed. It was owned by R. Brown and registered in London. At that time it was registered at Lloyd’s as a brig. In 1847 it was bought by William Younghusband and Co. of Adelaide, registered at that port (No. 9/1847), and is then referred to as a brigantine, so it is possible that the new owners changed the rig. Under the command of James C. Coke, it was sailing from Adelaide to Shanghai via Cape Riche, Albany and Singapore. The cargo included flour, which at that time was in very short supply in Western Australia, and the vessel’s arrival was looked forward to with some anxiety. The Wave had departed Adelaide on 5 June 1848, and was to take on a cargo of sandalwood at Albany.
THE LOSS
While anchored with two anchors down in Cheyne Bay near Cape Riche the Wave was hit by a heavy gale from the north-east which blew the brigantine ashore. The crew reached shore safely. The Reverend John Ramsden Wollaston, newly arrived in Albany, wrote in his diary: ‘Strong suspicions have since arisen that this wreck was purposely contrived to obtain the insurance’ (Henn, 1954: 39).
INITIAL SALVAGE
On receiving news of the wreck of the Wave the colonial schooner Champion under the command of Lieutenant Benjamin Franklin Helpman, then at Albany, sailed on 8 July to render assistance to the survivors, and to save what cargo it could. It managed to get the Wave off the shore, but the brigantine suddenly filled with water and sank. The Champion arrived back in Albany some days later with the crew and part of the damaged cargo. The crew, apart from the captain, were then taken on to Fremantle by the Champion, arriving there on 21 July. Captain Coke travelled back to Adelaide on board the Royal Navy’s paddle steamer HMS Acheron, commanded by Captain John Lort Stokes, ‘there being no probability of meeting at the Sound with a vessel proceeding to Adelaide direct, for some time’ (Sydney Morning Herald, 21 August 1848: 2b).
The brig Arpenteur, under the command of Captain Allen, was also employed in salvaging cargo from the wreck. The Arpenteur’s owners had purchased the wreck of the Wave and that cargo not already salvaged for £330. The brig is recorded as arriving in Fremantle on 20 August with a cargo consisting of ‘27½ tons flour, 1 000 bushels wheat, and the rigging, sails, &c., of the schooner Wave’ (Perth Gazette, 26 August 1848: 2a).
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Wave lies between the boat ramp and a small reef at Cape Riche.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The wreck lies in 3 m of water on a sand bottom. A large timber with lead sheathing, probably the stem post or gripe with what is most likely a section of the keel attached, is buried in the sand. Other wreck timbers lie trapped in the reef. A number of ceramic and glass sherds are scattered on the beach.
EXCAVATION AND ARTEFACTS
In January 1988 an inspection of the wreck of the Wave by Dr Michael McCarthy of the Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Museum, recovered a brass spike fragment and a stealer plank with copper spikes. Prior to this the finder, Robert Davy, had salvaged a holy-stone, some timber, a grind stone, scupper and copper bolts.","NO","West Indies","","1998/01","","3.29","N","2009/0213/SG _MA-63/88","Y","Y","-34.594518","","23.07","","118.751646","","","","Victoria  Bermuda","Port Adelaide","Adelaide","Shanghai","","Protected Federal","Worsley P. & J.

"William Wise","1847/06/15","","","","","","N","","","","","The William Wise was a London-registered 229-ton brig owned by R. Brooks.  It was built in 1826 at Lancaster for the London-Swan River run.
It left London on 11 January 1847 under command of Captain John Byron.  Arrived Fremantle via Cape Town on 4 June 1847, and anchored in Owen Anchorage.
On 15 June 1847:
A sudden and violent squall came on from a different quarter than it had been previously blowing from, caught her broadside on before she [had] time to swing round, and from her being light in the water, threw her completely on her beam ends, in which perilous position she remained for upwards of an hour; great fears were entertained that she would not right again, these were however happily proved unfounded (Perth Gazette, 19 June 1847: 2c).
This is confirmed by the Inquirer, 23 June 1847: 2b.
The William Wise, after a delay due to weather, sailed 1 August 1847 for London via Hong Kong with a cargo of 100 tons of sandalwood.  It arrived in London on 27 November 1847. (Worsley, P. pers. comm.). the watercolour by Richard Ffarrington (correct spelling) showing Aborigines fishing from the shore around a wreck with the nameplate 'The William Wise' lying nearby.  The Art Gallery brochure on Ffarrington's work which was exhibited in 1986 claims that 'the William Wise was a coastal trader.  The Perth Gazette reported it as having foundered in 1847.'  Obviously this is not correct as it is still in the 1848 Lloyd's Register.","NO","UK","","","","","","","N","","","","","","","","","","Lancaster","","","","","Not protected Federal","Perth Gazette, 19 June 1847: 2c

William Gray and Company built the Windsor at West Hartlepool, Durham, UK. The vessel had one deck and a 10-inch bar keel, with water ballast tanks 268 ft long holding 653 tons in a cellular bottom. The triple expansion engine was fed by two boilers working at a pressure of 160 lb/in2. In 1908 it was owned by Watts, Watts and Company, trading as the Britain Steamship Company. This company also owned 25 other steamers. At the time of wrecking there were two separate cargoes of sandalwood on board, Duncan Paterson and Company having 1?500 tons, while J. Stewart and Company were shipping 1?100 tons. Duncan Paterson and Company had a representative on board, Eric Warren, who was proceeding to Hong Kong on their behalf and was placed on the ship’s articles as a purser. Because of the twisted sandalwood timber taking up so much hold space, a lot of the 2 600 tons had to be carried as deck cargo. This reached a height of 3.4 m above the deck, but was well lashed down. The vessel and its cargo were insured for £25 000.
THE LOSS
The Windsor under the command of Captain James Walters with a crew of 37, had departed Fremantle for Hong Kong. The ship ran into heavy weather on leaving Fremantle but Captain Walters made what he considered sufficient allowance in the course steered to counter the expected drift caused by winds and current. He hoped to pass some 15 miles to the west of the Houtman Abrolhos, but at 9.50 p.m. on 2 February 1908, with Walters on the bridge, the Windsor struck on Half Moon Reef. The mainmast fell, the steamer’s bottom was torn out and its back broken.
The lifeboat and small jolly boat were swung out but it was decided that in the dark and with heavy seas running it would be dangerous to use them before daylight. About 11.00 a.m. on 3 February the boats were lowered. The third mate, John Gallop, the purser, the third engineer, Charles Robbins and an apprentice, Thomas Morley, manned the jolly boat and 12 of the mainly Chinese crew took to the lifeboat. After successfully reaching the comparative safety of the reef the lifeboat was hauled back to the wreck by rope. The jolly boat was used to take a few of the survivors to Pelsaert Island while others walked along the reef to the island. Four more crew, including the second mate, Charles Matthews, then also got to the reef in the lifeboat.
As soon as they became aware of the situation, Fallowfield and Company’s guano workers on Pelsaert Island came to render what assistance they could to the survivors. Darkness and a rising tide prevented any further attempts at rescuing those who remained on board the Windsor.
The following morning the lifeboat was found smashed, leaving those on the Windsor still stranded. The chief engineer, W. Jenkins, was drowned while attempting to swim a line to the reef. The small steamer Venus arrived on the scene and immediately took Warren and Robbins from Pelsaert Island to Geraldton to organize a rescue. Warren sent the following telegram to Duncan Paterson in Fremantle:
Vessel’s bottom torn out; back broken; mainmast gone. Engines swinging contrary ship. Very small chance salvage cargo. No chance ship. Chief engineer drowned. Found lifeboat smashed reefs, daylight yesterday. Might mean further loss of lives, probably Chinese. Cannot communicate with ship, although have been on the reef several times. Hurry rocket apparatus along. Captain, mate, three apprentices, 12 Chinese should still be aboard (WA, 6 February 1908: 7h)
The Venus returned to the site of the wreck with the Geraldton pilot, Gilmore, and Constable J. Heritage aboard, and with two boats in tow, one being the Geraldton lifeboat with some of its crew of local fishermen, H. Anderson, G. Neilson, F. Hansen, J. Jensen, R. Cain and Parker. It was hoped to float the boats down to the Windsor and haul them back with survivors aboard, but rough seas made this attempt futile. Increasingly high seas decided some of those sheltering in the bow to try to swim to the reef, rather than risk the results of the Windsor breaking up under them. At that stage the spray from breaking waves was being thrown over 30 m above the wreck. Fifteen men were successful, the last to leave being Albert Nicholson, one of the apprentices aged 15 years. Only the master and chief officer, David William Jones, remained aboard when the stern of the steamer where they were sheltering broke off and was smashed, drowning both men.
On receipt of the telegram Paterson contacted the chief harbour-master at Fremantle, Captain Irvine, and he immediately dispatched the government steamer Penguin under the command of Captain Airey to render assistance. The Penguin arrived in Geraldton on the night of 6 February, having made slow progress in the strong winds. Captain Airey had planned to go straight to the wreck but having averaged only 8 knots on the voyage north he decided that he could do no good at the islands in the dark. He decided to wait at Geraldton overnight and leave for the Abrolhos early the following morning. On board the Penguin was Officer Pym of the Rottnest Island Signal Station, who was in charge of the rocket life-saving apparatus. There was no rocket apparatus at Geraldton, a matter of great indignation at the time. Men on the Venus had tried to improvise by tying fishing lines to distress rockets in an attempt to get a line aboard the Windsor, and on a couple of occasions the survivors on the wreck had caught the lines but the fishing line had not been strong enough to haul a rope across.
The Underwriters’ Association chartered the tug Uraidla (Captain Williams) to take the chairman of the association, G. Evans, and their surveyor, Captain Charles Cutler, to the wreck site.
S. Mann and Beyer, two men from the guano diggings, were also drowned when the boat they were rowing from the settlement on Pelsaert Island to the reef to assist survivors was blown away in the southerly gale. Despite the Venus making a search of the islands neither they nor the boat were subsequently found.
INQUIRY
A preliminary court of inquiry held in Fremantle by the chief harbour-master, Captain Irvine, found that the helmsman had probably applied too much weather helm in an endeavour to counter the strong south-westerly seas that were tending to slew the bow of the Windsor to windward. This over compensation by the helmsman, combined with the inshore current, took the vessel to the eastward of the set course. The newspaper account states:
The fact of the vessel being so much out of her course is accounted for by those who know the locality by the fact that when a westerly wind is blowing, as it was on Sunday, a three-knot current sets in towards the islands (WA, 6 February 1908: 7h).
INITIAL SALVAGE
Much of the cargo of sandalwood was salvaged by Richmond ‘Dick’ Burton of Geraldton. There is no indication of salvage by other parties, and the position of the wreck would have made salvage an extremely hazardous undertaking. A newspaper stated that the underwriters would pay a bonus of £1.10.0 per ton wet and £2 per ton dry for all the sandalwood delivered to either Geraldton or Fremantle (WA, 8 February 1908:11g).
SITE LOCATION
The wreck of the Windsor is on the southern end of Half Moon Reef, about 7 km west of Wreck Point, Pelsaert Island, in the Houtman Abrolhos. The site is subject to heavy seas and is normally only accessible on the very few days with little or no swell.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The most visible evidence of the wreck site is the Windsor’s iron boiler, which reaches a height of 4 m above the reef and projects well above water level. There is wreckage spread out over a large area both on the reef and in the lagoon beyond, with the stern of the vessel lying towards the east and the bow towards the west. The material remaining includes the rudder, propeller, engine and a great deal of the ship’s structure. The force of the seas in this area is indicated by a 5–10 tonne section of the stern that has broken away and been carried some 400 m over the reef and into the lagoon.","NO","UK","37","1992/05","5","6.30","1 x tr.

"Xantho","1872/11/16","Port Gregory","William Denny and Company","Charles Edward Broadhurst","Captain Denicke","","Y","5.40","","Lead ore","AUS 741","Built in 1848 as a paddle steamer by the Denny Shipbuilding Company,  used by the Anstruther and Leith Steamship Company for crossings of the Firth of Forth between Leith and Aberdour. In 1860, sold and relocated to Scarborough. In July 1864,  sold again, and its register transferred to Wick, from where it was permitted to take excursions to sea.
In early 1871, PS Xantho was sold to the 'metal merchant' Robert Stewart of Glasgow, who replaced the paddle engines with a second-hand Crimean War-era two-cylinder, non-condensing trunk engine built ( or assembled) in 1861 by John Penn. Stewart also lengthened the vessel's stern and fitted a propellor and a new boiler. The Crimean War type gunboat engine and those built to the same design in the ensuing years were the first high-pressure, high-revolution and mass-produced engines made for use at sea.   The type also used Whitworth's Standard Thread throughout, allowing for interchangeability of parts. The refurbished, schooner-rigged SS Xantho was offered for sale in October 1871 and was purchased by Charles Edward Broadhurst, a Manchester-born entrepreneur involved in colonial ventures in north-west Australia.
Xantho was brought to Western Australia via the Suez Canal and the Straits Settlements for use by Broadhurst as a transport and mother vessel for pearling operations. Using the engine to enable it to sail into difficult harbours and against wind and tide Xantho was also effectively operated as a tramp steamer, taking whatever cargoes and passengers it could. In that role it became Western Australia's first coastal steamship. Xantho subsequently made two round trips between Fremantle, Batavia (now Jakarta), Geraldton and Broadhurst's pearling camps at Port Hedland and Banningarra (on Pardoo Station). Xantho also transported a number of northwest Aboriginal men from the Aboriginal prison at Rottnest Island back to their home near Cossack and Roebourne. In November 1879, whilst travelling down from the pearling grounds to Fremantle Xantho shipped a cargo of lead ore from Port Gregory, an outlet for the Geraldine Mine on the nearby Murchison River. Overloaded, its hull badly corroded and its deck planking opened by the tropical sun, Xantho began to take on water on the way down the coast. After returning to Port Gregory it struck a sandbar and sank.
The wreck lay forgotten until 1979 when, with the aid of local fishermen, it was located by the Maritime Archaeological Association of Western Australia, the volunteer wing of the Department of Maritime Archaeology at the Western Australian Museum. At the time iron and steam shipwrecks were effectively a new class of maritime archaeological site, requiring under the overall direction of Dr M. McCarthy a new approach in both archaeological method and conservation science commencing with a pre-disturbance survey, re-inspection and test excavation was conducted by corrosion specialists, biologists and archaeologists   It found that the propulsion system and part of the stern were in a uniformly good condition, although the rest of the remains were very fragile. The study also found that the engine and other prominent parts of the wreck were unlikely to last another fifty years. Anodes were applied to the engine in order to slow down its corrosion and commence the treatment process. In April 1985, the engine was removed from the wreck site in the context of an excavation of the stern and then transported to a treatment tank at the Museum, in Fremantle. Under the direction of corrosion specialists Neil North and then Ian MacLeod, the engine was initially inundated in a solution of sodium hydroxide to prevent further corrosion, while experiments as to the most effective method of removing the 2.5 to 5 centimetres (0.98 to 2.0 in) layer of concretion from the engine iron work were performed. By March 1993, 2,500 kilograms (5,500 lb) of concretion had been removed, while 48 kilograms (110 lb) of chlorides had been extracted from the engine by electrolysis.  A working model of the engine was produced by Bob Burgess using engineering drawings of the original produced by steam engineer Noel Millar. The model has allowed the Crimean War gunboat engine type, of which the Xantho engine is the only known surviving example, to be studied in operation. The engine was then disassembled under the leadership of conservator R. ( Dick Garcia) who had considerable experience in dismantling and restoring arms from WWII. As they were removed each of the engine's components were individually re-treated before it was gradually reassembled in the Museum's exhibition gallery as a 'work in progress' display.   By 2006, the conservation and reconstruction was complete and the engine could be turned over by hand.  A schematic showing the engine in action has also been produced and it can be viewed on the engine reconstruction section of the project website.  
The archaeology of the SS Xantho
The wreck of the SS Xantho presented many anomalous features requiring explanation, as did the engine when it was excavated from its layers of concretion and then disassembled. Apart from the hull being 23 years-old and worn out, the engine was already ten years old when fitted to the former paddle-steamer, and it was found to have been running backwards to drive the ship forward. Its rotation was, as a result, contrary to the maker John Penn's requirement, resulting in increased wear. When it was disassembled by the Museum's team, loose nuts were found lying in one cylinder and repairs to the engine were found to be very rudimentary. It was also found that the pumps could not be disconnected and they ran constantly, resulting in great wear on the valve stems. They were also were situated in the stern of the ship, rendering them useless when out of trim forward as Xantho was on its final voyage. The boiler relief valve was an outdated gravity variety and not the spring type generally used at sea to avoid problems as the vessel pitched and rolled. There was no condenser for recycling the used steam back into the boiler. All this made Broadhurst's decision to purchase Xantho for use in very saline waters, on a coast where fresh water supplies were practically non-existent and where there were no engineering facilities, the nearest workshops being in Surabaya or Melbourne, difficult to understand. This in turn required an understanding of his reasons both for purchasing the vessel and the manner in which he operated the ship. This in turn led to an attempt to understand his entrepreneurial style and given his remarkable propensity for failure, his staff and his support structures. These included his family, notably his remarkably talented wife Eliza Broadhurst and their son Florance Broadhurst. One result of this archival research was a reassessment of C.E. Broadhurst, who like Xantho, had been roundly dismissed as two of Western Australia's greatest colonial-era failures. In respect of the re-evaluation of the ship itself, the research led to a realisation that its purchase, despite its age and its many deficiencies, was a bold and logical stroke typical of an entrepreneur with great vision, but lacking the necessary access to finance and logistical support. Being mass-produced, for example, spare parts were readily available (a spare connecting-rod was found in the ship's engine room) and being very simple, easily-accessible and compact, repairs could be effected with only a rudimentary knowledge of marine engineering. On reflection it became apparent that Broadhurst also used Xantho primarily as a sailing ship and would not have used the ship's engine other than to assist him proceed when the wind was against him, especially when entering the often difficult tidal harbours on the north-west coast. Further, with an eye to obtaining the lucrative subsidy for operating a steamer to schedule on the coast, Broadhurst also appears to have made a point by steaming into port and thereby impressing a colonial administration crying out for steam transport on the coast. The Museum's exhibition on the SS Xantho is entitled 'Steamships to Suffragettes' focussing as much on the people involved (including the Broadhurst's suffragette daughter Katherine) as it does on the engine and its conservation.
 Indigenous Depictions
Xantho impacted both visually and socially on indigenous groups like the Jaburrara, Martuthunira, and Ngarluma people, who lived in the hinterland of Nickol Bay. Although no European illustrations of the ship exist, there are several examples of Aboriginal rock carvings at Inthanoona Station inland from Cossack identified as the SS Xantho. Rock art at Walga Rock is also believed to be depicting the vessel.","NO","Scotland","20","2003/10","","2.60","TR2 64 HP, first Paddle Steamer","2009/0216/SG _MA-9/79","Y","Y","-28.1865266667","","34.70","","114.236225","","","7802","Dumbarton","Port Gregory","","Fremantle","Obtained from aerial photograph DoLA 2004","Protected Federal","Sledge, S.,  1979, Xantho, Unpublished WreckInspection Report, Department Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Maritime Museum, No.40.

The Zeewijk did not break up immediately and goods, including the treasure chests, were transferred to Gun Island. It was obvious to the crew that the ship could never be floated from its position locked into the reef.
A rescue group of eleven of the fittest survivors and First Mate set off for Batavia in the longboat on 10 July, but were never heard of again.
In December 1727 two boys were found guilty of having committed sodomy together. They were sentenced to death and marooned, each boy on a separate island.
The survivors then built a boat enabling 82 out of the initial crew of 208 to reach their original destination of Batavia on 30 April 1728. Utilising materials from the wreck and local mangrove timber the crew constructed this boat, some sort of a sloop about 16.5 m long, which they named Sloepie, the first European boat built in Australia. On 26 March, 88 men set off on the one-month journey to Batavia. Six died on the way, leaving 82 of the initial 208 to arrive in Batavia on 30 April 1728.
Batavia's Council of Justice prosecuted skipper Jan Steins for losing the Zeewijk and falsifying the ship's records. He lost his position, salary and property to the Company.
In 1840 the crew of HMS Beagle found relics at the camp site, including a VOC cannon and two coins dated 1707 and 1720 which helped to confirm that the site was that of the Zeewijk. They named the Zeewyk Channel after the wreck. In the 1880s and 1890s a large volume of material was recovered during guano mining. Items including bottles, coins, wine glasses, jars, pots, spoons, knives, musket and cannon balls, tobacco and pipes were found.
Florance Broadhurst, son of entrepreneur Charles Edward Broadhurst and director of the Broadhurst and McNeil phosphate company, catalogued the finds, initially thinking they were from the VOC ship Batavia and ended up donating most to the Western Australian Museum in Perth. In 1952, during a visit to Geraldton, Lieutenant Commander M.R. Bromell of the Royal Australian Navy learned that rock lobster fisherman Bill Newbold had found a cannon on the seabed, and during a subsequent visit, Bromell located a cannon on the leeward side of the Half Moon Reef. After an elephant tusk found two years earlier put him on the trail, in March 1968 journalist and diver Hugh Edwards led divers Max Cramer, Neil McLaghlan and Museum staff Harry Bingham and Dr Colin Jack-Hinton to the seaward side of the reef to find the main wreck site. The Western Australian Museum subsequently conducted several expeditions to survey the site and to recover artefacts, the most notable in 1976 by Catharina Ingleman-Sundberg, who also completed a catalogue of all the finds from the site.","NO","Netherlands","208","1992/05","72","","N","2009/0002/SG _MA-455/71","Y","Y","-28.8838","","40.60","","113.8134","","","","Rammekens","Vlissingen","","Batavia","GPS","Protected Federal","Ingleman-Sundberg, C., 1977, The VOC Ship

THE VESSEL
The Zephyr was built by Daniel D, Kelley, a shipwright, dry dock operator and ship owner of East Boston. The ship had two decks, a round stern and a billet head. It was registered at New Orleans on 23 November 1865, presumably as the result of a sale to someone from that port. The owners prior to 17 October 1867 are not known, but on that date it was sold to three men, Francis Carter, Francis Peabody and (?) Peabody, all of Boston, and registered there as No. 202/1867. Each man had a one-third share in the ship. The Zephyr sailed from Chatham, New Brunswick, Canada, under the command of Captain Z. Springal with a cargo of sawn softwood timber, and arrived at Port Adelaide on 24 December 1883.
In early 1884 the Zephyr was seized by the Vice-Admiralty Court of South Australia for a debt of £35 19s owing to the Port Adelaide Steamtug Company (Limited).  This amount was for towage by the tug Yatala from Semaphore Anchorage in to Port Adelaide. The hearing was before the Chief Justice of South Australia, and an order for the sale of the ship was made on 14 March 1884. On 9 April 1884 a notice was placed in an Adelaide newspaper announcing that an auction of the Zephyr ‘with her tackle, apparel, and furniture’ would be held at noon the following day (South Australian Register, 9 April 1884: 8e). The purchaser was The Adelaide Steamship Company, who registered it at Port Adelaide.
The Zephyr was slipped on Fletcher’s Slip, stripped and re-sheathed, and anchored in the Port Adelaide River while the company advertised for a master mariner to sail it to Albany. This took some weeks to arrange. As the Zephyr was to take a cargo of coal to Albany, there was also a delay while the steamer Cintra brought 1 700 tons of coal down from Newcastle, NSW. The Cintra arrived on 21 July, and after the coal was transhipped the Zephyr sailed for Albany on 24 July, arriving there on 15 August 1884 having encountered severe weather which blew out two topsails.
THE LOSS
In October 1902 at the end of its useful life the Zephyr was beached and abandoned on the foreshore at Albany. The registration was closed in June 1903 with the notation ‘Broken up at Albany, WA’.
SITE LOCATION
The site of the wreck of the Zephyr is not known, but the remains are believed to lie under land reclaimed for modern port development.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
SOCIAL (3)
On arrival at Adelaide an American seaman on board the Zephyr, Rudolph Dedricks, was taken to Adelaide hospital with serious injuries. He made what a newspaper described as ‘certain charges against one of the officers of the vessel’ (South Australian Advertiser, 9 January 1884: 4g & 5a). As a result the American Consul, J.W. Smith, commenced enquiries, only to find that the Adelaide city coroner had already been to the hospital and taken a dying deposition from Dedricks. Smith was annoyed by this action stating that:
 it was the special duty of the representative of the American Government to make an enquiry, and apart from the question of the illegality of the “extraordinary proceedings” of the coroner, he (the consul) “looks upon them as an unwarrantable interference, and cannot refrain from describing them as officious” (ibid.).
The inquiry into the injuries suffered by Rudolph Dedricks of the Zephyr highlights the difficulties often faced when an incident involving foreign seamen is reported to authorities in Australia.
REPRESENTATIVE (8)
The Zephyr is representative of the many coal hulks stationed at ports on the Western Australian coast.

"Zuytdorp","1712/06/09","North of Kalbarri","VOC","VOC","Marinus Wijsvliet","On cliffs","Y","","","Coins, general cargo","AUS 332","This is the only ship that needs permission to dive on in WA. Protected zone 500 m around wreck.
On 1 August 1711 Zuytdorp (meaning ‘South village’) was dispatched from the Netherlands to the trading port of Batavia. It never arrived at its destination. No search was undertaken, since there was no idea where the ship was lost. The crew were never heard from again.
In 1834, Aborigines told a farmer near the recently colonised Perth about a wreck some distance to the North. With references to a wreck and coins on the beach, details strongly pointed to the Zuytdorp, however the colonists presumed it was a recent wreck and sent rescue parties who failed to find the wreck or any survivors.
In 1927 wreckage, mainly coins (some dated 1711), bottle fragments, timbers including a spar, carved female figure, breech blocks from swivel guns and other objects including evidence of a deliberately lit fire, were seen atop and at the foot of cliffs on the coast mid way between Tamala and Murchison House Stations on the mid-west coast. In 1954 following advice from Tamala Station head stockman Tom Pepper and a geologist Phillip Playford travelled to the site and viewed the site which had been seen by Pepper (a European who had married Lurlie Mallard an Aboriginal woman). Wreck material had also been seen by his Aboriginal family including Lurlie, her sister Ada and her husband Ernest Drage. The remains indicated that some survivors had got ashore from a then unknown wreck. In lying on the coast between two major Aboriginal encampments Wale Well to the north on Tamala Station and Billiecuthera Well to the south east on Murchison House Station, it was thought that the survivors may have joined the tribes  that travelled between those two centres. Phillip Playford was subsequently involved in a number of privately sponsored expeditions to the site, though at all times he and his companions were prevented from diving by the swells and the treacherous and extremely dangerous conditions offshore. Excavations were conducted and Playford subsequently produced a report describing and identifying the site mainly from the coins dated 1711. This was published by the Royal Western Australian Historical Society.
In 1964 a team led by Geraldton identity Tom Brady, including Graham and Max Cramer, conducted the first dive on the wreck, and on a subsequent dive later found a veritable 'carpet of silver'. This discovery was followed by many other dives, including those by the Underwater Explorer's Club, the Royal Australia Navy and by the controversial salvage diver Alan Robinson. Many injuries resulted and some of the accidents nearly proved fatal.
In 1969 the Western Australian Museum became responsible for the site and it commenced the recovery of the silver under the leadership of Harry Bingham. After 1971 the programme was led by Jeremy Green, with Geoff Kimpton (one of  Bingham’s team) as his chief diver. A caretaker, responsible for site security and a weather watch (there are only ever a few days per year where diving is possible) was established in quarters adjacent the site. Infrastructure in the form of a large flying fox erected on the cliffs was provided by the then owner of Murchison House Station, Prince ‘Jah’ the former Nizam of Hyderabad. This led to a number of very successful recoveries. In 1976 the wreck was protected under the terms of the Commonwealth Historic Shipwrecks Act and under the terms of that Act a restricted zone was declared around the site. This prohibits all bar bona fide visitation to the site. There appears to have been considerable unauthorised looting of the site on occasions when the weather allowed diving nonetheless. In 1981 the dangers of the site, in water, on the land, (including in the air due to a very dangerous airstrip) and human factors (including the firebombing of the caretaker's quarters) led to the programme being shelved and a resident abalone diver  appointed watchkeeper.
In 1986 the Museum's programme was resurrected under the leadership of Dr M. McCarthy concentrating as much on the social elements of the tragedy as it did on the recovery of what little remained of the silver and other objects. It also looked towards the production of a site plan  designed to examine theories about the wrecking and the possibility that survivors had got ashore. The expanded programme also focussed on the possible movement of survivors away from the wreck site and on the archaeological examination of the survivor's camps for evidence of intermingling with Indigenous people. This element  involved many specialists including anthropologists, prehistorians, historical archaeologists  and an expert metal detector operator. In 1986 Phillip Playford was invited to join the team with the express purpose of providing his knowledge and expertise to the Museum and of writing a popular book on the subject to add to his earlier academic works.
In 1994 a parliamentary select committee chaired by the Hon. P. G. Pendal, MLA, met in order to formally credit all who were involved in locating the British ship Tryall or Trial and the Dutch East Indiamen Batavia, Vergulde Draeck (Gilt Dragon), Zuytdorp and Zeewijk.
Many submissions were received from those who felt that they, or their
deceased relatives, had a role in the discoveries. In using the term ‘to discover’,
i.e. to ‘find out or become aware of, whether by research or by chance’, the
Committee in its report differentiated between ‘Primary Discoverers’, those
whose research led to the finding of a wreck, or were ‘physically involved in the
act of discovery’, and ‘Secondary Discoverers’, those whose involvement, in the
committee’s opinion, was ‘resultant’, ‘consequential’, ‘subordinate’ or ‘supporting’.
The distinction between Primary and Secondary Discoverers as defined in the
Pendal Committee Report was significant because ex gratia payments were awarded
to those Primary Discoverers still living. In 1997 amendments to the Maritime
Archaeology Act 1973 (WA) were enacted, containing a ‘Register of discoverers
of ancient shipwrecks’ with the intent of ‘providing statutory recognition of the
discoverers’ (see section 24 and the Third Schedule of the 1973 Act as amended).
The ‘Register of discoverers of ancient shipwrecks’ enacted in
1997 formalised the findings of the Pendal Committee in respect of Primary
and Secondary Discoverers and thus gave statutory recognition to the following
discoverers of the  Zuytdorp in the following manner:
Zuytdorp: That Tom Pepper and Phillip Playford be regarded as primary
discoverers and that Ada Drage, Max Cramer, Graham Cramer and Tom
Brady be recognised as secondary discoverers.
The families of some  of those involved did not agree with the Committee findings, however.","NO","Netherlands","200-250","1997/02","200-250","","N","2009/0017/SG _MA-460/71","Y","Y","-27.1861141667","","54.30","","113.9364534167","","","","Zeeland probably Vlissingen","Wielingen","Netherlands","Batavia","GPS SkyView","Protected Federal","Phillip Playford, Carpet of Silver, The Wreck of the Zuytdorp, University of Western Australia Press, 1996

for the shipping company, ‘Societe in Aziono Ungaro-Croata per la nar Libera’ on
a voyage from Passaman (Java) to Port Adelaide when it wrecked at Point Cloates
on 27 November, 1902. Zvir was carrying a cargo of sugar (The West Australian
22/12/1902) under charter to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The ship
initially grounded and extensive damage resulted in the vessel’s total loss at this
location (-22.6091666, 113.626 WGS 84). With no lives lost, the crew left the wreck
in the lifeboats and walked into Carnarvon. Two weeks later, as reported in The
Morning Herald (13/01/1903), the vessel was in ‘the same position intact but heeled
over to a heavy degree to starboard, the rail and upper deck being awash. Cargo
valued at £50, 000 being lost, swell breaking over decks, nothing could be saved
owing to the bad weather and that the steam lighter Beagle which was still standing
off was unable to get alongside’. All crew were rescued and repatriated to Austria
(Croatia), via Melbourne.
At the beginning of June 1903, the Harbour Authority of Rijeka undertook an
investigation into the conduct of Captain Ivan Randic and senior officers, including
Martin Sica-Susak, on duty when the wrecking occurred. Outcomes of this
investigation have not been located in the archives. Zvir was built by J. Preistman and
Company in Sunderland in 1900 as a 2-deck (1 steel, one part iron) screw steamer.
The dimensions for the vessel were 100.58 x 14.16 x 7.72m and gross tonnage was
3353.64. The name ‘Zvir’ translates to ‘spring’ or ‘well’ (Correspondence: Dr
Radojica Barbalic, 15/03/1982).
